  "problem_description": "### Query intent:\nThe SQL statement aims to retrieve specific information about sand and gravel deposits in relation to an outdoor recreation site inventory. It seeks to find details on the sand and gravel deposits near a particular outdoor recreation site based on its geographical coordinates and map number.\n\n### Detailed description:\n- **Tables Involved**: The query involves two tables, `sand_and_gravel_deposits` and `outdoor_recreation_sites_inventory`. \n  - `sand_and_gravel_deposits` contains information about sand and gravel deposits, including their unique identifier (`OBJECTID`) and type (`AG_TYPE`).\n  - `outdoor_recreation_sites_inventory` contains information about outdoor recreation sites, including their name (`SITE_NAME`), global identifier (`GlobalID`), and geographical coordinates (`X`, `Y`), as well as map information (`MAP`, `MAP_NUMBER`).\n\n- **Join Operation**: A `JOIN` operation is performed between `sand_and_gravel_deposits` and `outdoor_recreation_sites_inventory` using the common column `GlobalID` for `sand_and_gravel_deposits` and `OBJECTID` for `outdoor_recreation_sites_inventory`. This ensures that only records with matching identifiers are combined.\n\n- **WHERE Clause**: The main `WHERE` clause filters the results by matching the `SITE_NAME` from `outdoor_recreation_sites_inventory` with a value obtained from another subquery. This subquery filters `outdoor_recreation_sites_inventory` based on specific geographical coordinates (`X`, `Y`) and map information (`MAP`, `MAP_NUMBER`). \n\n### Business scenario:\nThis query can be used in scenarios where environmental management, resource exploration, or recreational planning agencies need to understand the proximity of sand and gravel deposits to specific outdoor recreation sites. For example, when planning new recreational areas, ensuring safety around potential sources of materials, or conducting environmental impact assessments.\n\n### User description:\nA user, possibly an environmental scientist or a project manager in a land development agency, might need this information to:\n- Ensure that new recreational areas are not built too close to hazardous sand and gravel deposits, which could pose risks to visitors or the natural environment.\n- Evaluate the potential use of nearby sand and gravel deposits for construction projects, considering their accessibility and environmental impact.\n- Plan routes or access points for outdoor activities that avoid sensitive geological features, enhancing visitor safety and preserving natural habitats.",
  "natural_language_query": "A user, possibly from an environmental management team or a land development agency, would likely be interested in knowing if there are any sand and gravel deposits in the vicinity of a specific outdoor recreation area they are planning to develop. To address this need, they would formulate a query as follows:\n\n\"Given a set of outdoor recreation sites mapped within our region, I'm looking to identify any sand and gravel deposits that are located near these sites. Specifically, I want to know if there are any deposits that could potentially affect the safety or environmental integrity of these recreation spots. The information should include details about the type of deposit and its geographical proximity to each site. Could you help me retrieve this data?\"\n\nTo achieve this, the SQL query would involve joining two tables: one containing information about sand and gravel deposits (with fields like OBJECTID and AG_TYPE) and another table with details about the outdoor recreation sites (including fields such as SITE_NAME, GlobalID, X-coordinate, Y-coordinate, MAP, and MAP_NUMBER). The query would filter the results based on the specific geographical coordinates and map information of the recreation sites, aiming to find matching sand and gravel deposits. This would provide insights into the potential environmental considerations and risks associated with the proposed recreation areas.",
