  "problem_description": "### Query intent:\nThe SQL statement aims to extract specific information from two related tables, `river_main_stem_waterbodies_wbid` and `sga_phase_2_assessed_reaches`, based on a matching condition between their respective columns.\n\n### Detailed description:\n1. **Table \"river_main_stem_waterbodies_wbid\"**:\n   - This table is referenced through its alias `river_main_stem_waterbodies_wbid`.\n   - The column of interest is `\"OBJECTID\"`, which is likely an identifier for each record within this table.\n\n2. **Table \"sga_phase_2_assessed_reaches\"**:\n   - This table is referenced through its alias `sga_phase_2_assessed_reaches`.\n   - The column of interest is `\"ProjectID\"`, which serves as a unique identifier for projects within this context.\n\n3. **Join condition**:\n   - The join condition specified is `\"sga_phase_2_assessed_reaches\".\"ProjectID\" = '指定项目ID'`.\n   - This condition indicates that only records from the `sga_phase_2_assessed_reaches` table where the `ProjectID` matches a specified project ID will be included in the result set.\n\n4. **Selected columns**:\n   - The query selects two columns: `\"OBJECTID\"` from `river_main_stem_waterbodies_wbid` and `\"ProjectID\"` from `sga_phase_2_assessed_reaches`.\n   - These columns are combined to provide a cross-reference between waterbody identifiers and associated project IDs.\n\n### Business scenario:\nThis SQL query might be used in environmental or project management contexts, particularly when dealing with large datasets containing information about river main stems, waterbodies, and projects that involve assessment or monitoring activities along these water bodies.\n\n### User description:\nA user might need this information when they are trying to correlate specific projects (identified by `ProjectID`) with detailed geographical data about waterbodies (identified by `OBJECTID`). This could be useful for tracking how different projects impact various sections of rivers, conducting impact assessments, or planning future interventions based on existing project data. For example, if a conservation group wants to assess the effectiveness of past projects on river health, they might use this query to gather necessary data.",
  "natural_language_query": "I'm looking to pull some data together for a project I'm working on. Specifically, I need to connect information about major river sections, or what we call \"waterbodies,\" with details of projects that have been assessed along those sections. I'm using a system that has two tables for this purpose: one for the main river sections (`river_main_stem_waterbodies_wbid`) and another for the projects (`sga_phase_2_assessed_reaches`).\n\nTo link these together, I need to match the unique identifier of a project in the second table (`sga_phase_2_assessed_reaches`), called `ProjectID`, with a specific project I'm interested in. Once matched, I want to see the corresponding `OBJECTID` from the first table, which is essentially the identifier for each section of the river.\n\nIn essence, I'm trying to find out which parts of the river were affected by certain projects. This could help us understand the impact of those projects on the river environment, which is crucial for our ongoing research and planning.",
