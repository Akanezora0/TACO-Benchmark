  "problem_description": "### Query intent:\nThe SQL statement aims to retrieve specific pieces of information from two related tables, `wildlife_management_units` and `wetland_ecologist_districts`, based on certain criteria.\n\n### Detailed description:\n\n1. **Tables Involved:**\n   - **`wildlife_management_units`**: This table contains information about units responsible for wildlife management. It likely includes fields such as `ABNAME` (abbreviation name), `BOUNDARY` (boundary identifier), and `AGENCY` (agency name).\n   - **`wetland_ecologist_districts`**: This table contains information about districts managed by wetland ecologists. It includes fields like `FirstName`, `LastName`, and `BOUNDARY`.\n\n2. **Columns Selected:**\n   - The query selects three columns:\n     - `wildlife_management_units.ABNAME`: Abbreviation name of the wildlife management unit.\n     - `wetland_ecologist_districts.FirstName`: First name of the wetland ecologist managing the district.\n     - `wetland_ecologist_districts.LastName`: Last name of the wetland ecologist managing the district.\n\n3. **Join Condition:**\n   - The query uses an INNER JOIN clause to combine rows from these two tables where the `BOUNDARY` field matches between the `wildlife_management_units` and `wetland_ecologist_districts` tables. This ensures that only matching records are returned.\n\n4. **Filtering Condition:**\n   - A WHERE clause filters the results to include only those records where the `AGENCY` field in the `wildlife_management_units` table equals `'AgencyName'`. This narrows down the results to specific agencies.\n\n### Business Scenario:\n\nThis SQL statement is typically used in a scenario where a system needs to provide detailed information about wildlife management units and their corresponding ecologists who manage wetland districts under a specific agency. For example, it could be part of a dashboard or report system designed for environmental management or conservation efforts within an organization.\n\n### User Description:\n\nA user might need this information for various purposes, such as:\n- **Staffing and Resource Allocation:** To understand which ecologists are responsible for which wildlife management units, especially when planning training sessions, resource needs, or emergency responses.\n- **Audit and Compliance:** To ensure that all areas under a particular agency's jurisdiction have been assigned to qualified ecologists, aiding in compliance with environmental regulations and standards.\n- **Strategic Planning:** To analyze the distribution of resources and expertise across different units, helping in strategic",
  "natural_language_query": "I'm working on a project that involves tracking the collaboration between wildlife management units and wetland ecologists. Specifically, I need to gather information about the units responsible for wildlife management and the ecologists managing wetland districts, especially those under 'AgencyName'. Could you help me construct a SQL query to extract the abbreviation name of the wildlife management unit and the first and last names of the ecologists managing the respective districts? It would be great if the query could show how these units and ecologists are linked through their shared boundaries, ensuring we get a comprehensive list for our analysis.",
