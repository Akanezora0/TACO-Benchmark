  "problem_description": "### Query intent:\nThe SQL statement is designed to retrieve specific data from two related tables, `outdoor_recreation_sites_inventory` and `invasive_species`, with the aim of identifying locations where a particular invasive species, specifically identified as 'Weed', has been observed. The retrieved data includes geographical coordinates (X, Y), site names, and the name of the invasive species observed at those sites. The results are sorted in descending order based on the acreage of land each site occupies.\n\n### Detailed description:\n1. **Table `outdoor_recreation_sites_inventory`**:\n   - **Columns**:\n     - `X`: Represents longitude coordinates of the site.\n     - `Y`: Represents latitude coordinates of the site.\n     - `NAME`: Identifies the name of the site.\n     - `OBJECTID`: A unique identifier for each record in this table.\n     - `ACREAGE`: Indicates the size of land area at each site.\n2. **Table `invasive_species`**:\n   - **Columns**:\n     - `SiteName`: The name of the site where an invasive species was observed.\n     - `ObservationID`: A unique identifier linking records in `invasive_species` to `outdoor_recreation_sites_inventory`.\n     - `InvasiveName`: The name of the invasive species observed.\n3. **Join operation**:\n   - The `INNER JOIN` clause combines rows from `outdoor_recreation_sites_inventory` and `invasive_species` based on matching values between `OBJECTID` in `outdoor_recreation_sites_inventory` and `ObservationID` in `invasive_species`. This ensures that only those sites with a recorded observation of the 'Weed' invasive species are included in the result set.\n4. **Filter condition**:\n   - `WHERE invasive_species.InvasiveName = 'Weed'` restricts the output to records where the invasive species observed is specifically 'Weed'.\n5. **Sorting**:\n   - `ORDER BY outdoor_recreation_sites_inventory.ACREAGE DESC` sorts the resulting records by the `ACREAGE` column in descending order, meaning the sites with the largest land areas are listed first.\n\n### Business scenario:\nThis SQL query is useful in environmental management and conservation efforts, particularly when monitoring the spread and impact of invasive species in outdoor recreation areas. It allows officials to quickly identify the largest areas affected by a specific invasive species, such as 'Weed', which might require targeted interventions or resource allocation for control measures.\n\n### User",
  "natural_language_query": "To address the scenario described, we would like to query a database containing information on outdoor recreation sites and invasive species. Specifically, we aim to find locations where the invasive species known as 'Weed' has been observed. Our interest lies in retrieving the geographical coordinates (X, Y) for these sites, along with their names and the species observed there. We further want the data to be sorted in descending order based on the size of the land area (ACREAGE) at each site.\n\nFor this purpose, we have two tables: `outdoor_recreation_sites_inventory` and `invasive_species`.\n\nThe `outdoor_recreation_sites_inventory` table includes columns such as:\n- X: Longitude coordinates of the site.\n- Y: Latitude coordinates of the site.\n- NAME: Name of the site.\n- OBJECTID: A unique identifier for each record within this table.\n- ACREAGE: Size of the land area at each site.\n\nThe `invasive_species` table contains details like:\n- SiteName: The name of the site where an invasive species was observed.\n- ObservationID: A unique identifier linking records in `invasive_species` to `outdoor_recreation_sites_inventory`.\n- InvasiveName: The name of the invasive species observed.\n\nOur query will utilize an INNER JOIN to combine records from both tables based on matching identifiers (OBJECTID and ObservationID), ensuring that only sites with observations of the 'Weed' species are included. We will then apply a WHERE clause to filter results for observations of 'Weed'. Finally, sorting the output by ACREAGE in descending order will highlight sites with the largest land areas affected by this invasive species.",
