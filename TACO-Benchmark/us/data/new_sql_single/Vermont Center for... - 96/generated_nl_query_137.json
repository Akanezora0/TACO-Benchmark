  "problem_description": "### Query intent:\nThe SQL statement is designed to retrieve specific details about a waste water facility based on its unique `FacilityID`.\n\n### Detailed description:\n1. **Tables Involved**: Two tables are involved - `waste_water_facilities` and `river_main_stem_waterbodies_wbid`. The `waste_water_facilities` table contains information about various waste water facilities, while the `river_main_stem_waterbodies_wbid` table seems to relate these facilities to river main stem water bodies via a common identifier (`WBID`).\n   \n2. **Columns Selected**:\n   - `X` and `Y`: These likely represent geographical coordinates (latitude and longitude) of the facility, possibly stored as separate columns for easier mapping or spatial queries.\n   - `FacilityName`: The name of the facility.\n   - `FacilityID`: A unique identifier for each facility.\n   - `WWInventoryURL`: The URL where more detailed information about the facility's waste water inventory might be found.\n\n3. **Join Condition**: An `INNER JOIN` clause is used to match records between `waste_water_facilities` and `river_main_stem_waterbodies_wbid` based on the equality of their `WBID` fields. This suggests that the query aims to retrieve data from facilities that have a corresponding entry in the `river_main_stem_waterbodies_wbid` table.\n\n4. **Filtering Condition**: The `WHERE` clause filters the results by specifying that only facilities with a `FacilityID` of '12345' should be returned. This indicates that the user is interested in detailed information about a specific facility identified by this ID.\n\n### Business Scenario:\nThis query could be used in environmental monitoring or compliance reporting scenarios where stakeholders need to access detailed information about a particular waste water treatment facility. For example, an environmental agency might use this query to gather data for auditing purposes, ensuring that a facility is meeting regulatory standards regarding its discharge into a river system.\n\n### User Description:\nA user, such as an environmental regulator or an engineer responsible for facility oversight, might need to quickly access and review the location, name, ID, and web resources related to a specific waste water treatment plant. This could be part of routine inspections, compliance checks, or when responding to reports of potential environmental issues.",
  "natural_language_query": "As an environmental regulator tasked with overseeing compliance at waste water facilities, I often need to access detailed information about specific plants to ensure they are adhering to environmental regulations. Today, I'm particularly interested in reviewing the details for a facility with the ID '12345'. Could you help me generate a SQL query that would provide me with the geographical coordinates (latitude and longitude), the name of the facility, its unique identifier, and the URL where I can find more information about its waste water inventory? This will assist me in my audit process and help ensure that all operations are in line with environmental protection standards.\n\nThe query I'm looking for should join the `waste_water_facilities` table with the `river_main_stem_waterbodies_wbid` table based on matching `WBID` values. My goal is to retrieve records that specifically pertain to the facility with the ID '12345', so the WHERE clause should filter results accordingly.",
