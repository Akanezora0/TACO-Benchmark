  "problem_description": "### Query intent:\nThe SQL statement aims to select specific attributes from two related tables, `sand_and_gravel_deposits` and `landslides`, based on certain conditions.\n\n### Detailed description:\n1. **Table `sand_and_gravel_deposits`**:\n   - **Columns**:\n     - `OBJECTID`: A unique identifier for each record in this table.\n     - `AG_TYPE`: The type of sand and gravel deposit (e.g., type A, B, C).\n   - **Role**: This table likely contains data about various sand and gravel deposits, including their types and possibly other characteristics.\n\n2. **Table `landslides`**:\n   - **Columns**:\n     - `OBJECTID`: A unique identifier for each record in this table.\n   - **Role**: This table probably contains data related to landslides, which might include landslide events and associated geographical features.\n\n3. **Join condition**:\n   - The `WHERE` clause `landslides.OBJECTID IS NOT NULL` suggests that the query is looking for rows in `sand_and_gravel_deposits` that have matching `OBJECTID` values with non-null entries in `landslides`. This indicates an inner join between these two tables based on the `OBJECTID`.\n\n4. **Selected columns**:\n   - The query selects `OBJECTID` and `AG_TYPE` from the `sand_and_gravel_deposits` table. It seems to be interested in retrieving the type of sand and gravel deposit associated with landslide events where such events exist.\n\n### Business scenario:\nThis query could be used in environmental management, particularly in assessing the risk of landslides affecting areas with specific types of sand and gravel deposits. For example, it might help identify if a certain type of sand and gravel deposit is more prone to landslides or if there are any known landslide-prone areas with specific deposit types.\n\n### User description:\nA user, perhaps an environmental scientist or a geologist, might need this information to analyze the relationship between different types of sand and gravel deposits and the occurrence of landslides. This could inform decisions on land use planning, construction safety, or natural disaster risk assessment in regions where these materials are prevalent.",
  "natural_language_query": "As an environmental researcher, I'm curious about the interplay between sand and gravel deposits and landslides in our region. Specifically, I'd like to know which types of sand and gravel deposits are associated with landslide events. To do this, I plan to cross-reference data from two databases: one containing information on sand and gravel deposits (`sand_and_gravel_deposits`) and another detailing landslide occurrences (`landslides`).\n\nFrom the `sand_and_gravel_deposits` database, I'm interested in retrieving the unique identifiers (`OBJECTID`) and the type of sand and gravel deposit (`AG_TYPE`). My goal is to find out if there's any overlap between these deposits and reported landslide events. To achieve this, I'm looking to run a SQL query that would join these two datasets on the common `OBJECTID` field, focusing only on those records where a landslide has been documented. This way, I can analyze whether certain types of sand and gravel deposits are more susceptible to causing or being affected by landslides.",
