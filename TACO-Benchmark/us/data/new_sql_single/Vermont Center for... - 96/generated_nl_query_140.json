  "problem_description": "### Query intent:\nThe SQL statement aims to retrieve specific details about water bodies from two related databases: `lakepond_wbids_and_wbid_segments` and `river_main_stem_waterbodies_wbid`. The primary goal is to extract the object identifier (`OBJECTID`), source (`Source`), water body ID (`WBID`), lake ID (`LAKEID`), and the name of the water body (`WBNAME`) for a particular water body ID.\n\n### Detailed description:\n- **Table `lakepond_wbids_and_wbid_segments`**:\n    - **Columns involved**: `OBJECTID`, `Source`, `WBID`, `LAKEID`.\n    - **Purpose**: This table contains segments of water bodies, likely including their identifiers, sources, and associated lake IDs.\n\n- **Table `river_main_stem_waterbodies_wbid`**:\n    - **Columns involved**: `WBID`, `WBNAME`.\n    - **Purpose**: This table provides the names of water bodies identified by their `WBID`.\n\n- **Join condition**: `lakepond_wbids_and_wbid_segments.WBID = river_main_stem_waterbodies_wbid.WBID`\n    - **Explanation**: This condition ensures that only records with matching `WBID`s are included in the result set, effectively linking segments of water bodies with their names.\n\n- **Where clause**: `lakepond_wbids_and_wbid_segments.WBID = '123'`\n    - **Explanation**: This clause filters the results to include only those records where the `WBID` matches the specified value '123'.\n\n### Business scenario:\nThis query could be part of an environmental monitoring system or a geographic information system (GIS) application designed to track and manage water bodies. It might be used to gather detailed information about a specific water body for analysis, reporting, or further integration into broader environmental studies or planning processes.\n\n### User description:\nA user working in an environmental conservation agency or a water management department might need this information to understand the characteristics of a specific water body (e.g., its location, size, and associated features like lakes). This data could be crucial for tasks such as water quality assessment, habitat management, or flood risk analysis.",
  "natural_language_query": "As an environmental officer at the city's conservation agency, I'm tasked with gathering comprehensive details about a particular water body for our ongoing study on urban water resources. Specifically, I need to access information on the object identifier, source, water body ID, lake ID, and the official name of the water body. To do this, I've decided to query two databases, `lakepond_wbids_and_wbid_segments` and `river_main_stem_waterbodies_wbid`, using a SQL statement.\n\nThe first database, `lakepond_wbids_and_wbid_segments`, contains segments of water bodies, detailing their identifiers, sources, and associated lake IDs. The second database, `river_main_stem_waterbodies_wbid`, holds the names of these water bodies, indexed by their unique `WBID`.\n\nTo connect these databases, I'll use a join condition where the `WBID` field in `lakepond_wbids_and_wbid_segments` matches the `WBID` field in `river_main_stem_waterbodies_wbid`. This ensures that each segment of the water body is linked to its corresponding name.\n\nFor the specific water body I'm interested in, which has a `WBID` of '123', I will add a `WHERE` clause to my query. This clause will filter out all other records, leaving me with the detailed information on this particular water body, including its name, which is crucial for our project's objectives.\n\nIn summary, my SQL query will look something like this:\n\n```sql\nSELECT \n    lakepond_wbids_and_wbid_segments.OBJECTID, \n    lakepond_wbids_and_wbid_segments.Source, \n    lakepond_wbids_and_wbid_segments.WBID, \n    lakepond_wbids_and_wbid_segments.LAKEID, \n    river_main_stem_waterbodies_wbid.WBNAME\nFROM \n    lakepond_wbids_and_wbid_segments\nJOIN \n    river_main_stem_waterbodies_wbid ON lakepond_wbids_and_wbid_segments.WBID = river_main_stem_waterbodies_wbid.WBID\nWHERE \n    lakepond_wbids_and_wbid_segments.WBID = '123';\n```\n\nThis query is essential for our team to understand the intricate details of the targeted water body, aiding in our efforts to preserve and manage our city's natural resources effectively.",
