  "problem_description": "### **Query intent**: \nThis SQL statement aims to retrieve detailed information about the treatment effectiveness of invasive species, focusing on specific conditions related to treatment type, assessment notes, chemicals used, application methods, personnel, and geographical details.\n\n### **Detailed description**:\n- **Tables Involved**: `invasive_species` is the primary table, which contains records of invasive species treatments. The `wildlife_management_units` table is joined based on the `TreatmentPerson` column, indicating the agency responsible for the treatment.\n- **Columns Selected**: `InvasiveName`, `ObservationDate`, `TreatmentDate`, and `TreatmentEffectiveness` are selected from the `invasive_species` table. These columns provide information about the species being treated, when observations were made, when treatments were applied, and the effectiveness of those treatments.\n- **Conditions Applied**:\n  - `TreatmentType = 'chemical'`: Narrowing down treatments that involve chemical substances.\n  - `TreatmentAssessmentNotes LIKE '%effective%'`: Filtering for treatments where the assessment notes indicate effectiveness.\n  - `ObservationDate BETWEEN '2023-01-01' AND '2023-12-31'`: Limiting the observation period to a specific year.\n  - `TreatmentAssessmentDate IN (SELECT invasive_species.AssessmentDate FROM invasive_species WHERE invasive_species.TreatmentDate IS NOT NULL AND invasive_species.TreatmentAssessmentDate IS NOT NULL)`: Ensuring that the treatment assessment date aligns with valid treatment dates.\n  - `TreatmentHours > 5`, `ChemicalName = 'example chemical'`, `ChemicalConsentration > 100`, `ChemicalOunces > 50`, `ApplicationMethod = 'spray'`, `CertifiedApplicator = 'John Doe'`, `EPARegistationNumber = 'XYZ123'`, `Town = 'Example Town'`, `GrossArea > 1000`, `InfestedArea > 500`, `Assessor = 'Jane Smith'`, `DistributionName = 'Example Distribution'`: Additional filters to specify the duration, chemical specifics, application method, personnel, location, and other attributes of interest.\n  - `AssessmentDate >= '2023-01-01' AND AssessmentDate <= '2023-12-31'`: Restricting the assessment period to the same as the observation period.\n  - `Treatment",
  "natural_language_query": "User: Hi, I'm trying to look into the effectiveness of treatments for invasive species in a specific area. I'm particularly interested in treatments that involve chemicals, have been deemed effective based on assessment notes, and took place within the year 2023. Also, I'd like to know more about the treatment details such as the type of chemical used, its concentration, the person who applied it, the method of application, the town where it was done, and the size of the area affected.
