This suggests that each landfill is associated with a specific ecological district.\n\n4. **Where clause**:\n   - Filters records in `wetland_ecologist_districts` where the `\"PROGMANAGER\"` field equals 'Program Manager'. This condition might be used to select only those districts managed by a specific program manager.\n\n5. **Order by clause**:\n   - Sorts the result set based on the `\"DATE_FIRST\"` column, indicating that the output should be ordered chronologically from the earliest to the latest date of landfill operation start.\n\n### Business scenario:\nThis query is designed for environmental management or",
  "natural_language_query": "I'm trying to gather detailed information about landfills and their associated ecological districts managed by a specific program manager. Specifically, I'm interested in knowing the name of the landfill site, its operational status, and whether it has any water quality monitoring or gas collection systems in place. Additionally, I'd like to know the town where each landfill is located, along with its size and the dates it started and stopped operating. By joining this data with the information about ecological districts, I aim to find out which districts have been managed by a program manager. Could you please provide me with this information, sorted by the earliest start date of the landfill operations?",
