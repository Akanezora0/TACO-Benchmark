  "problem_description": "### Query intent:\nThe SQL statement aims to retrieve specific information from two related tables, `lakepond_wbids_and_wbid_segments` and `landslides`, by performing an inner join operation on their corresponding IDs.\n\n### Detailed description:\n1. **Tables involved**:\n   - **`lakepond_wbids_and_wbid_segments`**: This table likely contains segments of geographic features or data related to lake ponds. It includes at least one column `OBJECTID` which uniquely identifies each segment.\n   - **`landslides`**: This table is presumably associated with landslide data. It also includes an `OBJECTID` column for unique identification, alongside a `GlobalID` column, which might be used for linking this table with others or referencing it in external systems.\n\n2. **Join condition**:\n   - The `INNER JOIN` clause is used to combine rows from both tables based on matching values between `WBID` (from `lakepond_wbids_and_wbid_segments`) and `GlobalID` (from `landslides`). This ensures that only records where these identifiers match are included in the result set.\n\n3. **Selected columns**:\n   - The query specifically selects `OBJECTID` from both tables (`lakepond_wbids_and_wbid_segments.OBJECTID` and `landslides.OBJECTID`). This suggests that the user is interested in identifying which segments of lake pond data are also linked to landslide occurrences within the system.\n\n### Business scenario:\nThis query could be used in environmental management or geographical analysis to correlate specific segments of lake pond data with potential landslide risks. For instance, in a project focused on understanding the impact of lake pond segments on local geology or in planning mitigation strategies for landslides.\n\n### User description:\nA user working in environmental science or urban planning might need to identify and analyze specific areas (represented by `OBJECTID`s) where lake ponds exist and where there is a risk of landslides. By running this query, they can efficiently cross-reference these areas against known landslide data, facilitating targeted studies or interventions.",
  "natural_language_query": "I'm looking to analyze the connection between certain areas of lake ponds and possible landslide risks in our database. Specifically, I need to find out if there's any overlap between the segments of lake ponds listed in the 'lakepond_wbids_and_wbid_segments' table and any recorded landslides. Could you help me with a SQL query that would allow me to see the 'OBJECTID's for both lake pond segments and landslide occurrences that share the same identifier? This would help me understand if any of our lake pond areas are at risk of landslides.",
