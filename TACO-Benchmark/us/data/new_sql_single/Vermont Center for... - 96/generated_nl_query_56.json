  "problem_description": "### Query intent:\nThe SQL statement aims to retrieve specific data from two related tables, `lakepond_wbids_and_wbid_segments` and `wetland_ecologist_districts`. The primary objective is to select certain attributes from these tables for further analysis or integration into another part of the system.\n\n### Detailed description:\n- **Table `lakepond_wbids_and_wbid_segments`**:\n    - **Column `OBJECTID`**: This column likely serves as a unique identifier for each record within this table, allowing for easy reference and tracking of individual segments or bids.\n  \n- **Table `wetland_ecologist_districts`**:\n    - **Column `AGENCY`**: This column might represent an agency or department responsible for managing or overseeing wetland ecologist districts, providing context about the organizational structure or responsibility associated with the geographic areas covered by the districts.\n\n- **Join condition**:\n    The SQL statement does not explicitly mention a join condition. However, given the syntax and the fact that both tables are referenced in the SELECT clause, it implies that there is an implicit join operation between `lakepond_wbids_and_wbid_segments` and `wetland_ecologist_districts`. This join likely connects records based on some common attribute(s) that are not shown in the SELECT statement but are assumed to exist in the database schema.\n\n### Business scenario:\nThis SQL query can be utilized in scenarios where there is a need to analyze or correlate geographic data related to wetland management and ecological districts with specific agencies or departments responsible for their oversight. For instance:\n\n- **Environmental Management**:\n    - Environmental managers might use this query to assess the relationship between specific wetland segments (identified by `OBJECTID`) and the agencies (`AGENCY`) responsible for their ecological conservation efforts.\n    \n- **Data Integration**:\n    - In a larger data integration project, this query could help in consolidating data from different sources (e.g., wetland segment data and agency management data) to provide a comprehensive view for decision-making processes related to environmental policies, resource allocation, or compliance monitoring.\n\n### User description:\nUsers might encounter situations where they need to understand the detailed management structure and responsibilities associated with specific wetland areas for various purposes such as regulatory compliance, strategic planning, or research. The ability to quickly access and analyze this information through SQL queries enhances efficiency and accuracy in handling such tasks.",
  "natural_language_query": "I'm trying to extract specific details from our database. Specifically, I'm interested in querying the 'lakepond_wbids_and_wbid_segments' and 'wetland_ecologist_districts' tables. My goal is to gather information on the unique identifiers for each segment or bid ('OBJECTID') alongside the responsible agencies ('AGENCY') for the wetland ecologist districts. \n\nCould you assist me with a SQL query that retrieves these details? It would be great if the query could also show how these two sets of data are connected, ideally through an implicit join, to provide a clearer picture of the relationship between the geographic segments and their management agencies.",
