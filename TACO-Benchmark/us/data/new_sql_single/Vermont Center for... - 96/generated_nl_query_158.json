  "problem_description": "### Query intent:\nThe SQL statement is designed to retrieve detailed information about parks and recreational facilities from two tables: `l` (likely representing \"location\" or \"land\") and `o` (possibly \"operation\" or \"outdoor activities\"). The query aims to extract specific attributes related to visitor data, park features, contact information, and operational details.\n\n### Detailed description:\n- **Table `l`**:\n    - `OBJECTID`: Unique identifier for each location.\n    - `FIELD_VISIT`, `VISIT_DATE`: Information related to field visits or dates of visits.\n    - `OBSERVER`: The observer or entity conducting the visit.\n- **Table `o`**:\n    - `MAP`, `MAP_NUMBER`, `SITE_NAME`: Geographical mapping details and site names.\n    - `PUBLIC_PRI`, `BOATING_MA`, `CAMPING`, `FIELD_SPOR`, etc.: Various public facility types and management statuses.\n    - `FIPS_CODE`, `DATE_`, `ALT_NAME`, `S_ADDRESS`, `S_TOWN`, `S_PHONE`, etc.: Additional geographical identifiers, addresses, phone numbers, and contact information.\n    - `OPERATOR`, `ORGANIZ`, `CO_ADDRESS`, `CO_TOWN`, `CO_STATE`, `CO_ZIP`, `CO_PHONE`, `CO_FAX`, `AH_O1_YN`, `AH_OTHR1`, `AI_O2_YN`, `AI_OTHR2`: Operational entities, their addresses, contacts, and yes/no fields indicating certain operational characteristics.\n\n### Business scenario:\nThis query can be utilized in various business scenarios, such as:\n- **Park Management**: To gather comprehensive data on park facilities, visitor access, and operational capacities for planning and resource allocation.\n- **Tourism and Recreation Planning**: To analyze trends in public use of different recreational activities across various locations for strategic planning and policy-making.\n- **Community Engagement**: To provide detailed information to the public about available amenities and services at parks and recreational areas for community engagement initiatives.\n\n### User description:\nUsers might face situations where they need to:\n- **Plan Community Events**: Quickly access information about available parks and recreational facilities suitable for hosting events, considering factors like contact information, facility types, and accessibility.\n- **Resource Allocation**: Identify parks with high usage or specific features needed for future developments or maintenance.\n- **Policy Development**: Base decisions on data-driven insights regarding public preferences and usage patterns of different recreational activities.\n- **Emergency Preparedness**: Utilize data on facilities",
  "natural_language_query": "I'm trying to gather detailed information about parks and recreational facilities for our community event planning. Specifically, I need to know about the types of facilities available, visitor data, contact information for operators, and any operational details that could help us decide where to host our event. Can you help me pull up all this data from your system?\n\nI'm particularly interested in understanding what kind of activities these places offer, like camping, boating, and sports fields. Also, it would be great if we could get the exact location details including the address, town, and phone number of each facility so we can reach out to the operators directly. Any information on whether the facility is publicly accessible or managed by a specific organization would also be very helpful. Lastly, if there's any indication of whether the facility has been used frequently or not, that could guide our decision on where to hold the event.",
