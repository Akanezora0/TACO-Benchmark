  "problem_description": "### Query intent:\nThe SQL statement aims to retrieve specific details about a waste water facility with a given ID ('12345') and its associated main river's ID and name.\n\n### Detailed description:\n1. **Table `waste_water_facilities`**:\n   - **Columns**: X, Y, FacilityName, FacilityID, WWInventoryURL\n   - **Purpose**: This table contains information about waste water facilities, including their geographic coordinates (X, Y), names (FacilityName), unique identifiers (FacilityID), and links to their inventory (WWInventoryURL).\n\n2. **Table `river_main_stem_waterbodies_wbid`**:\n   - **Columns**: OBJECTID, WBID, WBNAME\n   - **Purpose**: This table holds data about main river segments, with each row representing a distinct segment, identified by OBJECTID, and characterized by its unique ID (WBID) and name (WBNAME).\n\n3. **Join operation**:\n   - **Condition**: `waste_water_facilities.WBID = river_main_stem_waterbodies_wbid.WBID`\n   - **Purpose**: The join is performed to link each waste water facility with its corresponding main river segment based on the shared WBID.\n\n4. **WHERE clause**:\n   - **Conditions**: `waste_water_facilities.FacilityID = '12345' AND river_main_stem_waterbodies_wbid.WBNAME = 'Main River'`\n   - **Purpose**: Filters the joined data to only include records where the FacilityID matches '12345' and the WBNAME is specifically 'Main River', thus narrowing down to the details of a particular waste water facility and its associated main river.\n\n### Business scenario:\nThis query is particularly useful in environmental monitoring and management, especially in contexts where tracking the impact of waste water treatment plants on natural water bodies is crucial. For instance, regulatory agencies might use this information to assess compliance with environmental standards, evaluate pollution levels, or plan remediation efforts for affected river segments.\n\n### User description:\nA user, possibly an environmental scientist or a regulatory agency officer, might need this information to:\n- **Evaluate Compliance**: Check if a specific waste water treatment plant is discharging into the 'Main River' as expected, ensuring it adheres to environmental regulations regarding discharge locations.\n- **Impact Assessment**: Assess the potential environmental impact of the waste water treatment plant on the 'Main River', which could influence decisions on further treatment improvements",
  "natural_language_query": "I'm working on a project that requires detailed information about a specific waste water facility and its impact on the local water ecosystem. Specifically, I'm interested in understanding how the facility '12345' interacts with the 'Main River'. Could you help me retrieve the geographic coordinates (X, Y) of this facility, along with the unique identifier (WBID) and name of the main river it discharges into? This will assist in our assessment of compliance with environmental regulations and the overall health of the river ecosystem.",
