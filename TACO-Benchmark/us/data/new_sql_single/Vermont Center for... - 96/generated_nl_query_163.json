For example, it might help identify floodways near operational water supply systems that serve large populations and have significant water withdrawal capacities.\n\n### User description:\nA city planner or environmental scientist might need",
  "natural_language_query": "A city planner or environmental scientist might need to analyze the relationship between flood management systems and the operational water supply infrastructure within their jurisdiction. Specifically, they are interested in identifying floodways that intersect with areas served by water systems capable of providing substantial volumes of water (greater than 500 units per year) to populations exceeding 1,000 individuals. This analysis could be crucial for understanding potential vulnerabilities in water supply during flood events, ensuring that critical water infrastructure remains functional and accessible even under adverse conditions. To conduct this study, they would query the database using a SQL statement that joins datasets related to floodways and public water sources, filtering the results to highlight systems that meet the specified criteria for population served and water yield capacity.",
