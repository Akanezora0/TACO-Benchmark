  "problem_description": "### Query intent:\nThe SQL statement aims to retrieve the `SITE_NAME` from the `outdoor_recreation_sites_inventory` table where the `X` value matches a specific value found within the same table.\n\n### Detailed description:\n- **Table**: `outdoor_recreation_sites_inventory`\n  - This table likely contains records related to outdoor recreation sites, with each record having at least two fields: `SITE_NAME` (the name of the site) and `X` (a potential identifier or attribute related to the site).\n- **Column**: `SITE_NAME` and `X`\n  - `SITE_NAME` is the column we're interested in retrieving, as it identifies the site names.\n  - `X` is the column being compared against a specific value in the same query.\n- **Conditions**:\n  - The main condition involves comparing the `X` values in the `outdoor_recreation_sites_inventory` table. It uses a subquery to find a specific `X` value and then matches this value with the `X` column in the same table.\n\n### Business scenario:\nThis query might be used in a situation where you need to retrieve details about a specific outdoor recreation site based on an identifier (`X`). For instance, if you have a system tracking various outdoor sites for activities like hiking, camping, or fishing, and you need to fetch information about a particular site identified by its unique code or number.\n\n### User description:\nA user might need to access detailed information about a specific outdoor recreation site for planning purposes. For example, they could be looking for details such as location, amenities, entry fees, or opening hours for a site they plan to visit. By providing the unique identifier (`X`) of the site, they can execute this query to get all relevant information about that site from the database.",
  "natural_language_query": "To retrieve the name of a specific outdoor recreation site based on its unique identifier, I would formulate a SQL query as follows:\n\n```sql\nSELECT SITE_NAME \nFROM outdoor_recreation_sites_inventory \nWHERE X = (SELECT X FROM outdoor_recreation_sites_inventory WHERE [specific conditions]);\n```\n\nIn practice, the placeholder \"[specific conditions]\" would be replaced with actual criteria that uniquely identifies the target site. For instance, if the unique identifier is a serial number or a code associated with the site, the query would look something like this:\n\n```sql\nSELECT SITE_NAME \nFROM outdoor_recreation_sites_inventory \nWHERE X = 'S12345';\n```\n\nThis query aims to fetch the name (`SITE_NAME`) of the outdoor recreation site whose unique identifier (`X`) matches a specific value found within the `outdoor_recreation_sites_inventory` table.",
