  "problem_description": "### Query intent:\nThe SQL statement aims to retrieve the `OBJECTID` from the table `lakepond_wbids_and_wbid_segments` based on a specific `WBID`.\n\n### Detailed description:\n1. **Table**: `lakepond_wbids_and_wbid_segments`\n   - This is the main table from which data is being fetched. It likely contains various attributes related to `WBID`s (World Bank Identifiers) and possibly segmentations or classifications associated with these identifiers.\n\n2. **Column**:\n   - `OBJECTID`: This column seems to serve as a unique identifier for each record in the `lakepond_wbids_and_wbid_segments` table. It's typically used for referencing individual records in geographical databases or similar systems where spatial data is managed.\n\n3. **Condition**:\n   - `WHERE lakepond_wbids_and_wbid_segments.WBID = '指定WBID'`\n     - This condition filters the rows returned by the query to only those where the `WBID` column matches the specified value ('指定WBID'). This suggests that the user is interested in retrieving specific information about a particular World Bank Identifier.\n\n### Business scenario:\nThis query could be part of an application or system designed to manage and analyze data related to World Bank projects or initiatives. The specific use case might involve tracking, monitoring, or reporting on details associated with a particular `WBID`. For instance, this could be useful in scenarios such as:\n\n- **Project Monitoring**: An organization might need to retrieve detailed information about a project identified by a specific `WBID` for review, reporting, or compliance checks.\n- **Data Analysis**: Analysts could use this query to gather data points on a specific project for comparative analysis against others or to assess progress, budget, or outcomes.\n- **Reporting**: Reports requiring specific project details could be generated using this query, providing stakeholders with insights into a particular initiative's status or performance.\n\n### User description:\nUsers might encounter situations where they need to access detailed information about a specific World Bank project for various purposes such as decision-making, compliance reporting, or strategic planning. By executing this SQL query, users can efficiently retrieve the necessary data to address these needs without having to sift through all available records.",
  "natural_language_query": "User: I'm working on a project that requires detailed information about a specific World Bank project. Could you help me write a SQL query to fetch the unique identifier for this project from the database?\n\nDatabase Expert: Of course! To accomplish this, we'll need to write a SQL query targeting the `lakepond_wbids_and_wbid_segments` table. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```sql\nSELECT OBJECTID \nFROM lakepond_wbids_and_wbid_segments \nWHERE WBID = '指定WBID';\n```\n\nIn this query:\n- `OBJECTID` is the unique identifier for each record in our table.\n- `WBID` is the column containing the World Bank Identifiers.\n- `'指定WBID'` should be replaced with the actual World Bank Identifier you're looking up.\n\nThis query will return the `OBJECTID` corresponding to the specified `WBID`, allowing you to easily retrieve the detailed information about your project of interest.",
