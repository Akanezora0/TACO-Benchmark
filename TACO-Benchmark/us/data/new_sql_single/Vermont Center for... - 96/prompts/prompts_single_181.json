    "problem_description": "### Query intent:\nThe SQL statement aims to retrieve specific details from two related databases or tables, `dfirm_floodways` and `sga_phase_2_assessed_reaches`, under certain conditions.\n\n### Detailed description:\n- **Table `dfirm_floodways`**:\n  - **Columns involved**: `OBJECTID`, `DFIRM_ID`, and `FLOODWAY`.\n  - **Purpose**: This table likely contains information about floodways, including unique identification (`OBJECTID`), a primary identifier for floodway (`DFIRM_ID`), and a flag indicating whether it's a floodway (`FLOODWAY`).\n\n- **Table `sga_phase_2_assessed_reaches`**:\n  - **Columns involved**: `ProjectName` and `ProjectID`.\n  - **Purpose**: This table probably includes data on assessed reaches, such as project names (`ProjectName`) and unique identifiers for each project (`ProjectID`).\n\n- **Join condition**:\n  - The join is performed based on the condition `sga_phase_2_assessed_reaches.ProjectID = dfirm_floodways.DFIRM_ID`. This suggests that there's a one-to-many relationship between floodway records (in `dfirm_floodways`) and project records (in `sga_phase_2_assessed_reaches`), where each floodway is associated with a project identified by its `ProjectID`.\n\n- **Filtering condition**:\n  - The query filters records where `FLOODWAY` is set to `'Yes'`. This implies that only floodways marked as active or present in the system are selected.\n\n### Business scenario:\nThis SQL query is useful in scenarios where an organization needs to identify which projects are associated with floodways that have been flagged as existing or present. For example, environmental or infrastructure management departments might use this data to plan maintenance, upgrades, or emergency response strategies for flood-prone areas linked to these projects.\n\n### User description:\nUsers, typically those in environmental management or urban planning, might need this information to assess the risk associated with floodways near their projects, evaluate the impact of potential flood events on infrastructure, or plan mitigation strategies for flood-prone areas. This could also aid in compliance with regulations that require monitoring and managing flood risks in construction and development projects.",
