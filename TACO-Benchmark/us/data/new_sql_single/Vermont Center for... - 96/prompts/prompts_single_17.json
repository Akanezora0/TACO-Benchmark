    "problem_description": "### Query intent:\nThe SQL statement aims to retrieve all records from two related tables, `wetland_ecologist_districts` and `waste_water_facilities`, where there is a matching `FacilityID` between these two tables.\n\n### Detailed description:\n1. **Table `wetland_ecologist_districts`**:\n   - This table likely contains data about districts managed by ecologists within wetlands. It has an `OBJECTID` column, which seems to serve as a unique identifier for each record in this table.\n\n2. **Table `waste_water_facilities`**:\n   - This table contains information about waste water facilities. It includes a `FacilityID` column, which is used as a foreign key linking records in this table back to the `wetland_ecologist_districts` table via the `OBJECTID` field.\n\n3. **Join condition**:\n   - The `WHERE` clause specifies that a join should occur between these two tables on the condition that `wetland_ecologist_districts.OBJECTID` matches `waste_water_facilities.FacilityID`. This means the query is looking for records where a specific `FacilityID` (which is associated with a district) is found in both tables.\n\n### Business scenario:\nThis query could be used in environmental management or urban planning contexts to analyze the relationship between ecological districts and waste water facilities. For example:\n\n- **Environmental monitoring**: To identify which ecological districts have waste water facilities and assess their potential impact on local ecosystems.\n- **Policy development**: To understand the distribution of waste water treatment facilities across different ecological zones for policy-making purposes.\n- **Resource allocation**: To determine where resources might need to be allocated for upgrading or building new waste water facilities based on ecological considerations.\n\n### User description:\nA user, possibly an environmental scientist or a city planner, might use this query to gather data for a report on the current state of waste water management in relation to sensitive ecological areas. They would need to know which facilities exist in these areas, potentially for the purpose of evaluating compliance with environmental regulations, assessing pollution risks, or planning future infrastructure developments that minimize ecological impacts.",
