    "problem_description": "### Query intent:\nThe SQL statement aims to retrieve specific details about salt storage locations in Vermont along with their corresponding biophysical regions.\n\n### Detailed description:\n1. **Table**: `salt_storage_record_table` - This table contains records related to salt storage, including information such as the full address of each storage location and the length of storage in years.\n2. **Column**: `address_full` - This column in `salt_storage_record_table` stores the complete address of each salt storage location.\n3. **Table**: `vermont_biophysical_regions` - This table provides information about different biophysical regions within Vermont, likely mapping addresses to these regions.\n4. **Column**: `NAME` - This column in `vermont_biophysical_regions` likely represents the name or identifier of each biophysical region.\n5. **Join operation**: An inner join is performed between `salt_storage_record_table` and `vermont_biophysical_regions` based on matching values in the `address_full` column of `salt_storage_record_table` and the `NAME` column of `vermont_biophysical_regions`. This ensures that only records where the storage location's address matches an existing biophysical region in Vermont are included in the result set.\n6. **Where clause**: The condition `salt_storage_record_table.\"storage_length_years\" > 5` filters the resulting records to include only those where the storage duration is more than 5 years.\n\n### Business scenario:\nThis query is particularly useful for environmental or regulatory compliance checks in industries that manage large quantities of salt, such as road maintenance or agriculture. By linking storage locations (addresses) to their biophysical regions, stakeholders can:\n\n- Ensure that the salt storage practices adhere to local environmental regulations, which might vary by region due to differences in soil types, water bodies, and climate impacts.\n- Assess the potential environmental impact of long-term salt storage, especially concerning runoff and leaching into groundwater or surface water.\n- Plan for sustainable management strategies, such as implementing best practices for storing salt in areas that minimize environmental risks.\n\n### User description:\nA user working in environmental regulation or sustainability might need this information to:\n- Verify if salt storage facilities are located in sensitive areas (e.g., near wetlands, rivers) that require special handling due to potential ecological impacts.\n- Evaluate the need for additional monitoring or mitigation measures at sites where salt has been stored for an unusually long period, as this might increase the risk of unintended environmental consequences.\n- Support decision-making in policy development or enforcement actions related to salt usage and storage guidelines",
