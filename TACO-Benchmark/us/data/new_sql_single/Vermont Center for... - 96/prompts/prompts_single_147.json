This condition narrows down the dataset to a subset of sand and gravel deposits that meet this particular criterion.\n\n### Business scenario:\nThis SQL query could be part of a larger data analysis process aimed at identifying sand and gravel deposits that adhere to certain stringent conditions, which might include environmental regulations, safety standards, or resource management policies. For example, an environmental compliance department might use this query to ensure that all operational sites meet high safety and environmental standards.\n\n### User description:\nA user, possibly an environmental compliance officer or a project manager overseeing resource extraction activities, might need to verify that certain sand and gravel deposits are compliant with strict operational guidelines. By running this query, they can quickly identify which deposits fall under the category of '严格条件', facilitating further review and potential action if necessary. This could involve checking for compliance with local laws, assessing environmental impact, or ensuring that the extraction methods meet high safety standards.",
