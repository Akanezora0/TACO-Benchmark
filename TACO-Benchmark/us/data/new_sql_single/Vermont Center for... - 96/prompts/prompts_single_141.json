    "problem_description": "### Query intent:\nThe SQL statement is designed to retrieve specific information from two related tables, `waste_water_facilities` and `sand_and_gravel_deposits`, with the goal of identifying facilities that have non-null WWInventoryURLs.\n\n### Detailed description:\n1. **Table `waste_water_facilities`**:\n   - **FacilityName**: This column contains the names of the facilities related to waste water management.\n   - **WWInventoryURL**: This column holds URLs for inventory information related to each facility, which could be useful for further inspection or reporting purposes.\n\n2. **Table `sand_and_gravel_deposits`**:\n   - **AG_TYPE**: This column likely contains types of sand and gravel deposits, possibly related to environmental impact studies or resource management.\n   - **OBJECTID**: This column serves as a unique identifier for each record in the `sand_and_gravel_deposits` table, facilitating joins with other tables.\n\n3. **Join condition**:\n   - The SQL statement uses an INNER JOIN clause to combine rows from both tables based on matching FacilityID from `waste_water_facilities` and OBJECTID from `sand_and_gravel_deposits`. This ensures that only records where there is a direct correspondence between the two tables are included in the result set.\n\n4. **Where clause**:\n   - `waste_water_facilities.WWInventoryURL IS NOT NULL`: This condition filters the results to include only those facilities where the WWInventoryURL field is not empty or null. This might be useful for ensuring that all selected facilities have accessible inventory data for review or analysis.\n\n### Business scenario:\nThis SQL query can be utilized in several business scenarios within environmental management, such as:\n\n- **Facility Audit**: To identify and verify the inventory data of waste water facilities, ensuring compliance with environmental regulations or standards.\n- **Resource Management**: For tracking and analyzing the usage or impacts of sand and gravel deposits near or around waste water facilities, aiding in sustainable resource management strategies.\n- **Risk Assessment**: To assess potential environmental risks associated with specific facilities by cross-referencing their inventory data with nearby deposits.\n\n### User description:\nUsers, such as environmental scientists, engineers, or compliance officers, might need this information to perform audits, manage resources effectively, or assess and mitigate environmental risks. The query helps in quickly identifying facilities with accessible inventory data, which is crucial for detailed analyses or regulatory compliance checks.",
