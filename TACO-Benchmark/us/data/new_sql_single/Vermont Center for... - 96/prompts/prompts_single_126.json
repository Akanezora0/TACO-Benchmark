    "problem_description": "### Query intent:\nThe SQL statement aims to retrieve specific information from two tables related to environmental monitoring or regulatory compliance processes, particularly focusing on \"SGA Phase 2 Assessed Reaches\" and \"Salt Storage Record\" details.\n\n### Detailed description:\n\n#### Tables Involved:\n1. **sga_phase_2_assessed_reaches**:\n   - This table likely contains data about specific segments or reaches of waterways that have been assessed under SGA (Sustainable Groundwater Assessment) phase 2. It might include identifiers for these reaches, such as `SGAT_ID`, and flags indicating whether an assessment has been completed (`FinalA`).\n\n2. **salt_storage_record_table**:\n   - This table appears to contain records of salt storage locations. It includes details like the full address of the storage locations (`address_full`) and a unique identifier (`fulcrum_id`). The `fulcrum_id` is used to link this table with the `sga_phase_2_assessed_reaches` table.\n\n#### Columns Involved:\n- **sga_phase_2_assessed_reaches.SGAT_ID**: A unique identifier for each assessed reach of a waterway.\n- **salt_storage_record_table.address_full**: The full address of a salt storage location.\n\n#### Join Condition:\n- `sga_phase_2_assessed_reaches.RID = salt_storage_record_table.fulcrum_id`: This condition links the two tables based on their respective identifiers, suggesting that there's a direct relationship between assessed reaches and specific salt storage locations.\n\n#### Where Clause:\n- `sga_phase_2_assessed_reaches.FinalA = 'true'`: This condition filters the results to only include those reaches where the final assessment status is confirmed ('true'). This implies that only completed assessments are being considered.\n\n### Business Scenario:\nThis query could be used in a regulatory compliance context, particularly for environmental agencies responsible for overseeing the management of hazardous substances like salt. The scenario involves linking assessed waterway reaches to their corresponding salt storage locations, with a focus on areas that have undergone a complete assessment process.\n\n### User Description:\nUsers, typically environmental regulators or compliance officers, might need to identify and track the status of salt storage locations associated with certain waterway reaches that have been fully assessed. This could be crucial for ensuring that all storage practices comply with environmental regulations, especially concerning the safe handling and potential runoff impacts of salt usage in sensitive areas.",
