    "problem_description": "### Query intent:\nThe SQL statement is designed to retrieve specific information from two related databases: `wetland_ecologist_districts` and `outdoor_recreation_sites_inventory`. It aims to find the names of wetland districts (ABNAME) associated with sites of interest (`SITE_NAME`) that are linked through a specific geographic identifier (OBJECTID for the district and FIPS_CODE for the site).\n\n### Detailed description:\n- **Table `wetland_ecologist_districts`**:\n  - This table likely contains data about wetland ecologist districts, including unique identifiers (`OBJECTID`), district names (`ABNAME`), and possibly other relevant information about each district.\n\n- **Table `outdoor_recreation_sites_inventory`**:\n  - This table might contain information about outdoor recreation sites, including unique identifiers (`FIPS_CODE`), site names (`SITE_NAME`), and potentially other details such as location or type of activity.\n\n- **Join condition**:\n  - The SQL statement uses an INNER JOIN clause to combine rows from these two tables based on matching values between the `OBJECTID` column in `wetland_ecologist_districts` and the `FIPS_CODE` column in `outdoor_recreation_sites_inventory`. This ensures that only records where there is a direct match between a wetland district and an outdoor recreation site are included in the result set.\n\n### Business scenario:\nThis query could be useful in various environmental management, conservation, or tourism planning contexts. For example:\n\n- **Environmental Management**:\n  - Researchers or policymakers might use this query to analyze the overlap between protected wetland areas and potential sites for outdoor recreational activities. By identifying which wetland districts have associated recreation sites, they can assess the impact of these activities on the natural environment and plan for sustainable use.\n\n- **Tourism Planning**:\n  - Tourism planners could use the results to identify wetland districts that offer both ecological significance and recreational opportunities, aiding in the creation of eco-tourism itineraries that highlight the biodiversity and beauty of wetland ecosystems while respecting conservation needs.\n\n### User description:\nA user, perhaps a researcher or a government official responsible for environmental policy, might need this information to understand how human activities (like recreational visits) intersect with sensitive wetland areas. This could inform decisions on where to allocate resources for conservation efforts, how to manage visitor access to preserve habitats, or how to promote responsible tourism practices that minimize ecological impacts.",
