    "problem_description": "### Query intent:\nThe SQL statement is designed to retrieve specific information from two related databases, `wetland_ecologist_districts` and `outdoor_recreation_sites_inventory`. The primary goal is to find the names associated with a particular `ABNAME` (presumably an abbreviation for a district name) within the `wetland_ecologist_districts` table, and corresponding `SITE_NAME` (names of outdoor recreation sites) from the `outdoor_recreation_sites_inventory` table.\n\n### Detailed description:\n- **Table `wetland_ecologist_districts`**:\n    - **Column `OBJECTID`**: This column serves as a unique identifier for each row in the table, which is used as a condition for the join operation.\n    - **Column `ABNAME`**: This column contains abbreviated names of districts, which is the target column for the SELECT clause.\n- **Table `outdoor_recreation_sites_inventory`**:\n    - **Column `FIPS_CODE`**: This column likely contains codes identifying different regions or sites, which is matched against the `OBJECTID` in the `wetland_ecologist_districts` table.\n    - **Column `SITE_NAME`**: This column holds the names of various outdoor recreation sites, which is also selected for the output.\n\n- **Join Operation**:\n    - The SQL statement uses an `INNER JOIN` clause to combine rows from both tables based on the matching `OBJECTID` and `FIPS_CODE`. This ensures that only those rows where there is a match between the two tables are included in the result set.\n\n- **WHERE Clause**:\n    - The `WHERE` clause filters the results by specifying that only rows where `OBJECTID` equals `'1'` should be returned. This condition narrows down the search to a specific district identified by its unique `OBJECTID`.\n\n### Business scenario:\nThis query is useful in environmental management or planning contexts, particularly when dealing with conservation efforts or recreational planning. For example, it might be used to:\n\n- **Identify specific districts** that have been designated for wetland conservation or management, and then find the names of any outdoor recreation sites located within these districts.\n- **Cross-reference data** for strategic planning, ensuring that conservation efforts are aligned with recreational opportunities, or vice versa.\n\n### User description:\nA user, perhaps an environmental scientist, might need this information to understand the spatial distribution of conservation areas and recreational facilities within a specific geographic region.
