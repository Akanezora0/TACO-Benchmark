    "problem_description": "### Query intent:\nThe SQL statement aims to retrieve specific data from two tables (`invasive_species` and `lakepond_wbids_and_wbid_segments`) based on a given condition.\n\n### Detailed description:\n- **Tables involved**: The query involves two tables - `invasive_species` and `lakepond_wbids_and_wbid_segments`. It performs an INNER JOIN operation between these two tables.\n- **Columns selected**: The query selects columns `X` and `Y` from the `invasive_species` table. These columns likely contain specific attributes related to invasive species.\n- **Join condition**: The join is performed based on a common column named `OBJECTID`, which is found in both tables. This suggests that there is some relationship or shared information between records in these two tables that is being leveraged for the join.\n- **Filtering condition**: The `WHERE` clause filters the result set based on a condition where the `ObservationID` column in the `invasive_species` table equals the string `'12345'`. This implies that only rows with this exact `ObservationID` value will be included in the final output.\n\n### Business scenario:\nThis SQL query might be part of an environmental monitoring system designed to track and analyze invasive species populations in various lakes or ponds. The system could use such queries to:\n\n- **Analyze population distribution**: By querying for specific species (`X` and `Y` could represent location coordinates), the system can provide insights into where invasive species are most prevalent or have been observed.\n- **Track species over time**: If the system has historical data, it could compare current observations (`ObservationID`) against past ones to monitor changes in species distribution or abundance.\n\n### User description:\nA conservation biologist or environmental scientist might need to quickly access detailed information about the locations (coordinates) of a particular invasive species that has been observed at a specific site (`ObservationID = '12345'`). This could help in planning targeted interventions or further research to understand and mitigate the impact of the invasive species in question.",
