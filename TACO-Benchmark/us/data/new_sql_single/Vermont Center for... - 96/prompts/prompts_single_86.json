    "problem_description": "### Query intent:\nThe SQL statement aims to select specific data from the `sand_and_gravel_deposits` table based on a condition related to the attribute `AG_TYPE`.\n\n### Detailed description:\n1. **Table**: `sand_and_gravel_deposits` - This table is likely part of a database that contains information about sand and gravel deposits. It may include details such as deposit location, type, size, and other relevant attributes.\n\n2. **Columns**:\n   - `OBJECTID`: This column might represent a unique identifier for each record in the table, useful for referencing or linking records across different datasets.\n   - `GlobalID`: Another identifier, possibly unique across the entire system, which could be used for cross-referencing with other databases or systems.\n   - `AG_TYPE`: This column is expected to contain the type of deposit, here specifically filtered to only include records where `AG_TYPE` equals 'Quarry'.\n\n3. **Condition**: `sand_and_gravel_deposits.AG_TYPE = 'Quarry'` - The query filters the records in the `sand_and_gravel_deposits` table to only include those where the `AG_TYPE` attribute has the value 'Quarry'. This suggests that the user is interested in data pertaining to quarries specifically.\n\n### Business scenario:\nThis query could be used in various business contexts related to mining, construction materials management, environmental monitoring, or geographic information systems (GIS). For instance:\n\n- **Mining Industry**: Mining companies might use this query to analyze and manage their quarry operations, ensuring compliance with regulations, optimizing resource allocation, or conducting environmental impact assessments.\n  \n- **Construction Materials Supply Chain**: Construction firms or material suppliers could leverage this query to track inventory, monitor quarry productivity, or plan logistics based on the availability of specific types of sand and gravel.\n\n- **Government Regulatory Agencies**: Environmental or mining regulatory bodies might use this query to monitor compliance with environmental standards, assess the sustainability of quarry operations, or conduct audits.\n\n### User description:\nA user, perhaps an environmental scientist, an operations manager in a construction company, or a government inspector, might need to access detailed information about quarries within a specific area or under certain conditions. For example, they might require a list of all quarries within a designated region to evaluate their impact on local ecosystems or to ensure they are operating within legal guidelines.",
