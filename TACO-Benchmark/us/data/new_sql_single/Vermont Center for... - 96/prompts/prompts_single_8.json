    "problem_description": "### Query intent:\nThe SQL statement is designed to retrieve specific records from two related tables: `landfills` and `dfirm_floodways`. The primary objective is to identify matching \"OBJECTID\" values between these two tables.\n\n### Detailed description:\n- **Tables involved**:\n  - `landfills`: This table contains data related to landfills, with each entry identified by an \"OBJECTID\".\n  - `dfirm_floodways`: This table likely contains data about floodways (areas prone to flooding) associated with certain locations, also uniquely identified by \"OBJECTID\".\n\n- **Columns involved**:\n  - `landfills.\"OBJECTID\"`: This column is used as a key for matching records between the two tables. It represents the unique identifier for each entry in the `landfills` table.\n  - `dfirm_floodways.\"OBJECTID\"`: Similarly, this column serves as a matching key for the `dfirm_floodways` table.\n\n- **Join condition**:\n  The SQL statement uses an INNER JOIN clause to combine rows from `landfills` and `dfirm_floodways` where the value of `\"OBJECTID\"` in both tables matches. This ensures that only records with corresponding \"OBJECTID\" values in both tables are returned.\n\n### Business scenario:\nThis SQL query is typically used in environmental management or urban planning contexts. For instance, it might help in identifying specific landfills that are located near flood-prone areas, which could be crucial for risk assessment, disaster preparedness, or compliance with environmental regulations.\n\n### User description:\nUsers, such as environmental scientists, city planners, or regulatory officers, might need this information to perform various tasks:\n- **Risk Assessment**: To evaluate the potential impact of flooding on existing landfills and plan necessary safety measures.\n- **Compliance Monitoring**: Ensuring that landfills are appropriately located away from flood zones to prevent environmental pollution during extreme weather events.\n- **Resource Allocation**: Prioritizing resources for the maintenance and monitoring of landfills based on their proximity to flood-prone areas.\n\n### Conclusion:\nIn summary, the provided SQL statement is a powerful tool for integrating and analyzing data from two different sources (landfills and floodways) to uncover insights relevant to environmental management and urban planning. By focusing on matching \"OBJECTID\" values, it enables users to address critical issues related to safety, compliance, and resource allocation effectively.",
