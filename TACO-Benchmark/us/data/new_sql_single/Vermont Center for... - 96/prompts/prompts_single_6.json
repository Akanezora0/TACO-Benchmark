    "problem_description": "### Query intent:\nThe SQL statement aims to retrieve specific data from two related tables: `dfirm_floodways` and `salt_storage_record_table`. The primary goal is to join these two tables based on a specific condition and then extract certain fields for further analysis or reporting.\n\n### Detailed description:\n\n1. **Table `dfirm_floodways`**:\n   - **Columns involved**: `OBJECTID`, `FLD_ZONE`.\n   - **Purpose**: This table likely contains information about floodway systems within a given geographical area, where `OBJECTID` serves as a unique identifier for each record, and `FLD_ZONE` could be a field indicating the zone or location within the floodway system.\n\n2. **Table `salt_storage_record_table`**:\n   - **Columns involved**: `address_full`, `address_sub_thoroughfare`.\n   - **Purpose**: This table probably holds records of salt storage locations, with `address_full` providing a complete address, and `address_sub_thoroughfare` potentially detailing a sub-street or a more specific part of the address.\n\n3. **Join condition**:\n   - **Condition**: `dfirm_floodways.FLD_ZONE = salt_storage_record_table.address_sub_thoroughfare`.\n   - **Purpose**: The join condition links records from `dfirm_floodways` to those in `salt_storage_record_table` based on matching `FLD_ZONE` values with `address_sub_thoroughfare` values. This indicates an attempt to correlate floodway zones with specific salt storage addresses within those zones.\n\n### Business scenario:\n\nThis query is particularly useful in environmental management or urban planning contexts. For instance, it might help in assessing the risk of salt storage facilities being located near potential flood zones, which could impact safety and environmental considerations.\n\n### User description:\n\nA user, possibly an environmental engineer or urban planner, might need this information to perform a spatial analysis. They could use the results to identify any potential risks associated with the proximity of salt storage facilities to flood-prone areas. This could inform decisions on whether existing storage locations should be relocated or if additional safety measures are needed at those sites.\n\n### Additional notes:\n\n- **Data Integrity**: Ensuring that both tables have accurate and up-to-date information is crucial for reliable results.\n- **Spatial Analysis Tools**: Depending on the environment in which this query is run, additional tools or frameworks (like GIS software) might be necessary to visualize and analyze the spatial relationships between the floodways and salt storage locations effectively.",
