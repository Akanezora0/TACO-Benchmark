    "problem_description": "### Query intent:\nThe SQL statement aims to retrieve specific information from two related databases, `sga_phase_2_assessed_reaches` and `outdoor_recreation_sites_inventory`. The primary goal is to fetch unique RIDs (Record Identification) from the `sga_phase_2_assessed_reaches` table and corresponding CO_ADDRESSES (Street Addresses) from the `outdoor_recreation_sites_inventory` table.\n\n### Detailed description:\n- **Tables Involved**: \n    - `sga_phase_2_assessed_reaches`: This table likely contains data about assessed reaches (possibly river segments or trails) within a phase 2 project. It includes a column `RID` for Record Identification.\n    - `outdoor_recreation_sites_inventory`: This table contains inventory data about outdoor recreation sites, possibly including their addresses. It includes an `OBJECTID` column for identification and a `CO_ADDRESS` column for street addresses.\n\n- **Columns Selected**:\n    - `RID`: A unique identifier for each record in the `sga_phase_2_assessed_reaches` table.\n    - `CO_ADDRESS`: The street address associated with each outdoor recreation site in the `outdoor_recreation_sites_inventory` table.\n\n- **Join Condition**:\n    - The `INNER JOIN` clause connects these two tables based on matching `OBJECTID` values in both tables. This ensures that only records where there is a direct correspondence between the two datasets are included in the result set.\n\n- **Filtering Condition**:\n    - The `WHERE` clause filters out any rows from `outdoor_recreation_sites_inventory` where the `CO_ADDRESS` is `NULL`. This means only records with valid street addresses will be returned.\n\n### Business Scenario:\nThis query might be used by environmental or recreation management agencies to gather detailed information about specific assessed reaches that are near or directly connected to outdoor recreation sites. For instance, it could help in planning maintenance routes, identifying potential access points for visitors, or assessing ecological impacts on recreational areas.\n\n### User Description:\nUsers might need this information to:\n- Plan maintenance schedules for river segments that are close to popular hiking trails or picnic areas.\n- Ensure accessibility and safety at recreational sites by knowing the exact locations of infrastructure like bridges or campgrounds.\n- Conduct environmental impact assessments for new developments near natural resources, ensuring compliance with regulations and minimizing negative effects on wildlife habitats and public access routes.\n\nBy executing this SQL query, users can efficiently retrieve the necessary information to make informed decisions regarding resource management, planning, and compliance",
