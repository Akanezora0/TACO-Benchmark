This table is likely associated with managing information about outdoor recreation sites, possibly including details like site names, coordinates (X, Y), and other relevant attributes.\n\n### Detailed description:\n1. **Table**: `outdoor_recreation_sites_inventory`\n   - This table contains records related to various outdoor recreation sites. Each record typically includes details such as the site's name, its geographical coordinates (X, Y), and possibly additional metadata.\n\n2. **Columns**:\n   - `X`: Likely represents the longitude coordinate of the site on a map.\n   - `Y`: Likely represents the latitude coordinate of the site on a map.\n   - `SITE_NAME`: The name of the outdoor recreation site.\n\n3. **Conditions**:\n   - `outdoor_recreation_sites_inventory.SITE_NAME = '某特定名称'`: This condition filters the records to only include those where the `SITE_NAME` column matches a specific predefined value, '某特定名称'. This implies that the user is interested in details about a particular outdoor recreation site by its name.\n\n### Business scenario:\nThis query could be part of an application or system designed for outdoor enthusiasts or park management services. It might be used in several contexts:\n\n- **Park Management**: A park manager might use this query to retrieve the exact location (coordinates) of a specific site for maintenance or inspection purposes.\n- **Tourist Information**: A tourism app could use this to provide users with detailed information about a particular outdoor activity location, such as hiking trails, camping spots, or picnic areas.\n- **Event Planning**: For organizing events at specific outdoor locations, event planners could use this query to ensure the chosen site meets their requirements regarding accessibility and size.\n\n### User description:\nA user, perhaps a park ranger, a tourism app developer, or an event planner, might need to know the precise location of a certain outdoor site. They would use this SQL query to fetch the coordinates of that site, enabling them to plan routes, set up facilities, or direct visitors accurately.",
