The intent is to fetch the `OBJECTID`, `LOCCONF`, and the name of an outdoor recreation site where the location configuration (`LOCCONF`) is 'Urban' and the name of the site is 'Central Park'.\n\n### Detailed description:\n1. **Table `landfills`**:\n   - **Columns**: `OBJECTID`, `LOCCONF`, and potentially more (not explicitly mentioned but often included in such tables for geographical or administrative purposes).\n   - **Role**: This table likely contains information about landfills, including unique identifiers (`OBJECTID`), and geographical or administrative configurations (`LOCCONF`).\n\n2. **Table `outdoor_recreation_sites_inventory`**:\n   - **Columns**: `NAME`, among others (not specified but could include details like location, type, etc.).\n   - **Role**: This table contains records of various outdoor recreation sites, including their names.\n\n3. **Join condition**:\n   - **On**: `landfills.LOCCONF = 'Urban' AND outdoor_recreation_sites_inventory.NAME = 'Central Park'`.\n   - **Purpose**: To filter results where the location configuration is specifically 'Urban' and the name of the outdoor recreation site matches 'Central Park'. This implies a join operation between these two tables based on common fields or keys not explicitly shown but likely inferred.\n\n4. **Select clause**:\n   - **Columns**: `landfills.OBJECTID`, `landfills.LOCCONF`, and `outdoor_recreation_sites_inventory.NAME`.\n   - **Purpose**: To select specific pieces of information from the joined tables, focusing on the unique identifier of a landfill, its location configuration, and the name of a particular outdoor recreation site.\n\n### Business scenario:\nThis SQL query could be used in urban planning or environmental management projects where one needs to analyze the proximity or overlap between landfills and public recreational areas within urban zones. For instance, it might help in assessing potential impacts of landfills on nearby parks or recreational sites, guiding decisions on waste management and urban development strategies.\n\n### User description:\nA city planner or environmental scientist might need this information to evaluate the suitability of certain areas for new developments while ensuring compliance with environmental standards and community welfare. They would require data on both landfills and nearby recreational sites to make informed decisions about zoning laws, waste disposal locations, and green",
