  "problem_description": "### Query intent:\nThe SQL statement aims to retrieve specific data from two related tables (`wetland_ecologist_districts` and `public_water_sources`) based on certain conditions.\n\n### Detailed description:\n\n1. **Tables involved:**\n   - **`wetland_ecologist_districts`** : This table is joined with another table, likely containing information about districts managed by ecologists. The table includes columns like `OBJECTID`, `ABNAME`, `AGENCY`, `DEPT`, and `DIV`.\n   - **`public_water_sources`** : This table contains information about public water sources. It has a column `WSID` which is used for joining purposes.\n\n2. **Columns selected:**\n   - `wetland_ecologist_districts.OBJECTID`: A unique identifier for each district.\n   - `wetland_ecologist_districts.ABNAME`: Abbreviation or name of the district.\n   - `wetland_ecologist_districts.AGENCY`: The agency managing the district.\n   - `wetland_ecologist_districts.DEPT`: Department within the agency responsible for the district.\n   - `wetland_ecologist_districts.DIV`: Division or additional detail about the district.\n\n3. **Join condition:**\n   - The `wetland_ecologist_districts.OBJECTID` is used as a foreign key to join this table with the `public_water_sources` table on the basis of the `WSID` column. This indicates that each row in `wetland_ecologist_districts` might correspond to multiple rows in `public_water_sources`.\n\n4. **Where clause:**\n   - The `WHERE` clause filters the rows in the `public_water_sources` table where `SystemStatus` is set to `'Active'`. This means only water sources that are currently active will be considered in the final result.\n\n### Business scenario:\n\nThis SQL query can be used in a scenario where an environmental management system or a public utility company needs to check the current status of water sources that are managed or monitored by ecologists or specific departments within an agency. For example, it could help identify which active water sources fall under the jurisdiction of certain districts, agencies, or departments.\n\n### User description:\n\nA user from an environmental protection agency or a water management department might need to know which active water sources are being supervised by their team (identified by district and agency). This information is crucial for planning maintenance, monitoring quality, or responding to potential issues at these sources. The SQL",
  "natural_language_query": "As an environmental protection officer, I'm trying to gather data on active water sources that are currently being managed by our agency. We're particularly interested in understanding which districts, under our jurisdiction, have active water sources. Could you help me construct a SQL query that retrieves the following details for each district?\n\n- A unique identifier for each district\n- The abbreviation or name of the district\n- The agency responsible for managing the district\n- The specific department within the agency that oversees the district\n- Any additional division or detail about the district's management\n\nWe're using a system where we track both our wetland ecologist districts and the public water sources they manage. To link these two sets of data, we use a common identifier: the OBJECTID from the wetland ecologist districts table and the WSID from the public water sources table. Our focus is on those water sources that are currently 'Active'. Could this SQL query be designed to filter out all inactive water sources, ensuring we only see the active ones associated with our districts?",
