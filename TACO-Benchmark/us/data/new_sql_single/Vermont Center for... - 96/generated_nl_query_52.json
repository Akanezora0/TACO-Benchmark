  "problem_description": "### Query intent:\nThe SQL statement aims to select specific details about outdoor recreation sites from the `outdoor_recreation_sites_inventory` table based on various criteria.\n\n### Detailed description:\n- **Table**: `outdoor_recreation_sites_inventory`\n  - This table likely contains data about different outdoor recreation sites, including their names, acreage, and various features related to activities they offer.\n\n- **Columns**:\n  - `NAME`: The name of the outdoor recreation site.\n  - `ACREAGE`: The size of the site in acres.\n  - `MAP_NUMBER`: A unique identifier for each site's map or location.\n  - `SKIING`, `SKIDOWN`, `SKINSCUB`, `SNOWMOB`, `SNOWSHO`: Binary indicators (Yes/No) specifying whether the site supports skiing, downhill skiing, snorkeling, snowmobiling, and snowshoeing respectively.\n  - `SKI_TYPE`: Specifies the type of skiing offered (e.g., Downhill).\n  - `N_LIFTS`, `N_DOWNHILL`: Numeric values indicating the number of lifts and downhill slopes available for skiing.\n  - `Q_SNOWMAKE`, `TOTALFLDS`, `Q_TENNIS`, `Q_BASKET`, `Q_VOLLEY`, `Q_PICNIC`, `Q_PICSHEL`, `PLYGND`, `N_REGHOLES`, `Q_BASEB`, `Q_SOFTB`, `Q_LITLEA`, `Q_SOCCR`, `Q_FOOTB`, `OTHFLD`, `TOTALCRTS`: Quality ratings or counts of various facilities or amenities like snowmaking equipment, total fields, tennis courts, basketball courts, volleyball courts, picnic areas, playgrounds, regulation holes for sports, and other fields.\n\n### Business scenario:\nThis query is useful for administrators or planners who need to find outdoor recreation sites that meet specific requirements. For instance, they might want to identify sites with ample ski facilities, well-equipped for various sports, and offering multiple amenities.\n\n### User description:\nUsers might encounter situations where they need to compare different outdoor recreation sites based on their facilities and capacities. For example, an event organizer looking for a venue for a large-scale winter sports festival would use this query to find suitable locations that have sufficient ski slopes, appropriate sports facilities, and adequate space. Similarly, a government body responsible for maintaining public parks might use this query to assess and potentially improve existing facilities across different sites.",
  "natural_language_query": "User: Hi, I'm planning an event and I'm trying to find the best outdoor recreation sites for it. I need a place that offers skiing, has plenty of facilities, and is big enough to accommodate our needs. Can you help me find such sites?\n\nAssistant: Assistant: Of course! To assist you, we'll be querying our database which holds information about various outdoor recreation sites. We're interested in finding sites that include skiing facilities, have ample space, and offer a range of amenities suitable for your event.\n\nHere's how we'll structure the query:\n\n1. **Sites with Skiing Facilities**: We'll look for sites where skiing is either available (`skiing = 'Yes'`) or downhill skiing is supported (`skidown = 'Yes'`).\n2. **Adequate Size**: We'll filter by acreage to ensure the sites are sizable enough for your event (`acreage > X`, where X is the minimum acreage required).\n3. **Facility Counts**: We'll check for a good number of facilities such as snowmaking equipment (`q_snowmake > Y`), tennis courts (`q_tennis > Z`), basketball courts (`q_basket > W`), and so on, to make sure the sites are well-equipped.\n4. **Other Amenities**: We'll also consider other amenities like picnic areas (`q_picnic > A`), playgrounds (`plygnd > B`), and sports facilities to enhance the visitor experience.\n\nTo get started, could you please provide us with the minimum acreage, facility counts, and other specifics you're looking for? This will help narrow down the results to most relevant sites.",
