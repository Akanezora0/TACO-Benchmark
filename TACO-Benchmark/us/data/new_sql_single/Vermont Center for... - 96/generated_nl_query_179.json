  "problem_description": "### Query intent:\nThe SQL statement aims to extract specific data from two tables, `salt_storage_record_table` and `sga_phase_2_assessed_reaches`, focusing on details related to storage addresses and URLs associated with a particular project.\n\n### Detailed description:\n- **Table `salt_storage_record_table`**:\n    - **Column `address_full`**: This column likely contains detailed addresses related to storage locations where salt is stored.\n    - **Column `OBJECTID`**: A unique identifier for each record in this table. It's used as a join condition with the `sga_phase_2_assessed_reaches` table.\n\n- **Table `sga_phase_2_assessed_reaches`**:\n    - **Column `URLPage1`**: This column is expected to hold the URL of the first page related to a specific assessment phase of the project, potentially containing more detailed information about the project or its aspects.\n    - **Column `ProjectID`**: Identifies the project to which the assessment applies. In this query, it is specifically set to `'specific_project_id'`.\n\n- **Join operation**:\n    - The `INNER JOIN` clause is used to combine rows from both tables based on matching `OBJECTID` values. This means only records where there is a match between the `OBJECTID` in `salt_storage_record_table` and `sga_phase_2_assessed_reaches` will be included in the result set.\n\n- **Where clause**:\n    - The `WHERE` clause filters the results further by specifying that only rows where `ProjectID` equals `'specific_project_id'` should be returned. This ensures that the query targets data specifically related to the project identified by this ID.\n\n### Business scenario:\nThis query could be part of a larger system designed to manage and track the storage and assessment of salt or similar resources across different projects. The system might need to report or analyze data related to storage locations and their associated assessments for a specific project.\n\n### User description:\nA user, possibly a project manager or an inventory specialist, might need to quickly access the addresses where salt is stored (`address_full`) and the primary web resource (`URLPage1`) for assessing the project's progress or compliance related to these storage locations. This information is crucial for regulatory compliance checks, inventory management, or planning purposes.",
  "natural_language_query": "As a project manager overseeing several storage locations for salt, I am looking to gather detailed information for one specific project. I need to compile the full addresses where salt is stored (`address_full`) and access the primary web resource (`URLPage1`) for assessing the project's progress or compliance at those locations. The project I'm focusing on has an ID of 'specific_project_id'. Could you please help me retrieve this information?",
