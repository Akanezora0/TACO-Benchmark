  "problem_description": "### Query intent:\nThe SQL statement is designed to retrieve specific information from two related tables, `waste_water_facilities` and `sand_and_gravel_deposits`, with the goal of identifying facilities that have non-null WWInventoryURLs.\n\n### Detailed description:\n1. **Table `waste_water_facilities`**:\n   - **FacilityName**: This column contains the names of the facilities related to waste water management.\n   - **WWInventoryURL**: This column holds URLs for inventory information related to each facility, which could be useful for further inspection or reporting purposes.\n\n2. **Table `sand_and_gravel_deposits`**:\n   - **AG_TYPE**: This column likely contains types of sand and gravel deposits, possibly related to environmental impact studies or resource management.\n   - **OBJECTID**: This column serves as a unique identifier for each record in the `sand_and_gravel_deposits` table, facilitating joins with other tables.\n\n3. **Join condition**:\n   - The SQL statement uses an INNER JOIN clause to combine rows from both tables based on matching FacilityID from `waste_water_facilities` and OBJECTID from `sand_and_gravel_deposits`. This ensures that only records where there is a direct correspondence between the two tables are included in the result set.\n\n4. **Where clause**:\n   - `waste_water_facilities.WWInventoryURL IS NOT NULL`: This condition filters the results to include only those facilities where the WWInventoryURL field is not empty or null. This might be useful for ensuring that all selected facilities have accessible inventory data for review or analysis.\n\n### Business scenario:\nThis SQL query can be utilized in several business scenarios within environmental management, such as:\n\n- **Facility Audit**: To identify and verify the inventory data of waste water facilities, ensuring compliance with environmental regulations or standards.\n- **Resource Management**: For tracking and analyzing the usage or impacts of sand and gravel deposits near or around waste water facilities, aiding in sustainable resource management strategies.\n- **Risk Assessment**: To assess potential environmental risks associated with specific facilities by cross-referencing their inventory data with nearby deposits.\n\n### User description:\nUsers, such as environmental scientists, engineers, or compliance officers, might need this information to perform audits, manage resources effectively, or assess and mitigate environmental risks. The query helps in quickly identifying facilities with accessible inventory data, which is crucial for detailed analyses or regulatory compliance checks.",
  "natural_language_query": "To gather information on facilities managing waste water that have accessible inventory data, I aim to write a SQL statement that combines details from two related databases: 'waste_water_facilities' and 'sand_and_gravel_deposits'. The objective is to pinpoint facilities that possess non-null WWInventoryURLs, which could be essential for conducting thorough inspections or reports.\n\nFirstly, let's consider the structure of these databases:\n\n1. **waste_water_facilities**:\n    - **FacilityName**: This column contains the names of facilities engaged in waste water management.\n    - **WWInventoryURL**: This column holds URLs pointing to inventory information related to each facility, enabling access to detailed records for further scrutiny or documentation.\n\n2. **sand_and_gravel_deposits**:\n    - **AG_TYPE**: This column is expected to detail the types of sand and gravel deposits, potentially relevant for environmental impact assessments or resource management activities.\n    - **OBJECTID**: Serving as a unique identifier for each record within 'sand_and_gravel_deposits', this column facilitates the connection between different database entries, ensuring accurate data alignment during the join process.\n\nNext, we'll utilize an INNER JOIN clause to merge data from both tables based on matching FacilityID in 'waste_water_facilities' and OBJECTID in 'sand_and_gravel_deposits', ensuring only relevant and corresponding records are included in our final output.\n\nFurthermore, we'll incorporate a WHERE clause to filter our results, focusing solely on facilities where the WWInventoryURL field is not empty or null. This criterion ensures that our selection includes only those facilities equipped with accessible inventory data, crucial for detailed analyses or compliance reviews.\n\nIn essence, this SQL query is designed for professionals involved in environmental management, including environmental scientists, engineers, and compliance officers. These individuals often require this information to conduct audits, manage resources efficiently, or assess and mitigate environmental risks. By identifying facilities with accessible inventory data, the query enables quick and targeted analyses, supporting informed decision-making and regulatory compliance.",
