  "problem_description": "### Query intent:\nThe SQL statement aims to retrieve all records from two related tables, `wetland_ecologist_districts` and `waste_water_facilities`, where there is a matching `FacilityID` between these two tables.\n\n### Detailed description:\n1. **Table `wetland_ecologist_districts`**:\n   - This table likely contains data about districts managed by ecologists within wetlands. It has an `OBJECTID` column, which seems to serve as a unique identifier for each record in this table.\n\n2. **Table `waste_water_facilities`**:\n   - This table contains information about waste water facilities. It includes a `FacilityID` column, which is used as a foreign key linking records in this table back to the `wetland_ecologist_districts` table via the `OBJECTID` field.\n\n3. **Join condition**:\n   - The `WHERE` clause specifies that a join should occur between these two tables on the condition that `wetland_ecologist_districts.OBJECTID` matches `waste_water_facilities.FacilityID`. This means the query is looking for records where a specific `FacilityID` (which is associated with a district) is found in both tables.\n\n### Business scenario:\nThis query could be used in environmental management or urban planning contexts to analyze the relationship between ecological districts and waste water facilities. For example:\n\n- **Environmental monitoring**: To identify which ecological districts have waste water facilities and assess their potential impact on local ecosystems.\n- **Policy development**: To understand the distribution of waste water treatment facilities across different ecological zones for policy-making purposes.\n- **Resource allocation**: To determine where resources might need to be allocated for upgrading or building new waste water facilities based on ecological considerations.\n\n### User description:\nA user, possibly an environmental scientist or a city planner, might use this query to gather data for a report on the current state of waste water management in relation to sensitive ecological areas. They would need to know which facilities exist in these areas, potentially for the purpose of evaluating compliance with environmental regulations, assessing pollution risks, or planning future infrastructure developments that minimize ecological impacts.",
  "natural_language_query": "As an environmental scientist working on a project to evaluate the integration of waste water management systems within protected ecological zones, I'm looking to run a SQL query to gather comprehensive data. My goal is to identify all instances where waste water facilities are located within districts managed by ecologists within wetlands. \n\nTo achieve this, I plan to join two tables: `wetland_ecologist_districts` and `waste_water_facilities`. The `wetland_ecologist_districts` table contains detailed information about each district, including a unique identifier known as `OBJECTID`. On the other hand, the `waste_water_facilities` table lists various waste water facilities, featuring a `FacilityID` that acts as a reference to connect these facilities back to the districts they are situated within.\n\nMy SQL query will look something like this:\n\n```sql\nSELECT * FROM wetland_ecologist_districts \nJOIN waste_water_facilities ON wetland_ecologist_districts.OBJECTID = waste_water_facilities.FacilityID;\n```\n\nBy executing this query, I aim to obtain a list of all waste water facilities, along with the corresponding district information, ensuring a thorough understanding of how these facilities are distributed across ecologically significant areas. This data will be crucial for developing strategies that balance environmental conservation with effective waste management practices.",
