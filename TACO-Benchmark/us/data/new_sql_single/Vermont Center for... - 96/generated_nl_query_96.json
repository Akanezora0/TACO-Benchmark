  "problem_description": "### Query intent:\nThe SQL statement aims to retrieve specific information from two related databases: `public_water_sources` and `dfirm_floodways`. The primary goal is to identify water sources (`X`, `WaterType`) that are associated with floodways where the condition `FLOODWAY = 'Yes'` is met.\n\n### Detailed description:\n1. **Table `public_water_sources`**:\n   - **Columns**: `WSID`, `ConstructedDate`, `X`, `WaterType`\n   - **Description**: This table contains records about various water sources, including their identifiers (`WSID`), construction dates (`ConstructedDate`), geographical coordinates (`X`), and types (`WaterType`).\n\n2. **Table `dfirm_floodways`**:\n   - **Columns**: `DFIRM_ID`, `FLOODWAY`\n   - **Description**: This table contains records about floodways, including unique identifiers (`DFIRM_ID`) for each floodway and a flag (`FLOODWAY`) indicating whether a floodway exists ('Yes' or 'No').\n\n3. **Join Condition**:\n   - `INNER JOIN public_water_sources ON public_water_sources.WSID = dfirm_floodways.DFIRM_ID`: This condition links the two tables based on the matching identifiers between `WSID` in `public_water_sources` and `DFIRM_ID` in `dfirm_floodways`.\n\n4. **Filter Condition**:\n   - `WHERE dfirm_floodways.FLOODWAY = 'Yes'`: This condition filters out only those rows from the joined tables where the floodway exists.\n\n5. **Sorting Order**:\n   - `ORDER BY public_water_sources.ConstructedDate DESC`: This sorts the resulting dataset in descending order based on the construction date of the water sources, allowing the most recently constructed water sources to appear first.\n\n### Business scenario:\nThis SQL query is particularly useful in environmental management and urban planning contexts. It helps identify which water sources are located in areas prone to flooding (indicated by `FLOODWAY = 'Yes'`). This information can be crucial for several purposes:\n\n- **Risk Assessment**: Understanding which water sources are at risk can help prioritize them for additional safety measures or for monitoring during high-risk weather events.\n- **Infrastructure Planning**: For new developments or infrastructure upgrades, this data can guide decisions on where to avoid constructing sensitive facilities or how to protect existing ones from flood impacts.\n- **Emergency Response**: In case of a flood emergency, having a list of water sources near",
  "natural_language_query": "To address the business scenario you've outlined, we aim to identify water sources in areas prone to flooding. To do this, we will consult two databases: `public_water_sources` and `dfirm_floodways`. Our objective is to find water sources that intersect with floodway areas where flooding is confirmed ('Yes' in the `FLOODWAY` column). \n\nHere's how we plan to execute this task through a structured query:\n\n1. **Data Retrieval**: We will start by fetching all records from the `public_water_sources` database, which contains information on water sources such as their identifiers (`WSID`), the date they were constructed (`ConstructedDate`), their geographical coordinates (`X`), and their type (`WaterType`).\n\n2. **Database Linkage**: Next, we will join this data with the `dfirm_floodways` database using an `INNER JOIN`. This operation requires matching identifiers between `WSID` in `public_water_sources` and `DFIRM_ID` in `dfirm_floodways`. This ensures we're comparing water sources directly with known floodway areas.\n\n3. **Condition Application**: To filter our results, we apply a condition that selects only those records where the floodway status (`FLOODWAY`) is marked as 'Yes'. This narrows down our focus to areas of concern, highlighting potential risks for water sources.\n\n4. **Ordering Results**: Finally, we sort our findings in descending order based on the construction date of the water sources (`ConstructedDate`). This allows us to prioritize more recently constructed water sources, which might require immediate attention due to their proximity to flood-prone areas.\n\nBy executing this query, we aim to create a comprehensive list of water sources that need special consideration for flood mitigation strategies. This information can be invaluable for environmental assessments, urban planning, and emergency response efforts, ensuring that resources are allocated effectively to safeguard these critical infrastructure elements.",
