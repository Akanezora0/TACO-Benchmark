The columns `OBJECTID`, `SITE_NAME`, and `AH_O1_YN`, `AI_O2_YN` are key parts of this discussion.\n   - `OBJECTID`: A unique identifier for each record in the inventory.\n   - `SITE_NAME`: The name of the outdoor recreation site.\n   - `AH_O1_YN`: A boolean or string field indicating whether a specific condition (related to AH) is met for the site. Here it's set to 'Y'.\n   - `AI_O2_YN`: Similarly, another boolean or string field indicating whether another condition (related to AI) is met for the site. Here it's set to 'N'.\n\n2. **`sga_phase_2_assessed_reaches`**: This table likely contains assessments of certain phases related to stream gauges or similar infrastructure. The columns `SGAT_ID`, `ProjectName`, and `RID` are significant here.\n   - `SGAT_ID`: An identifier for the assessment record.\n   - `ProjectName`: The name of the project associated with the assessment.\n   - `RID`: A reference identifier that links records between the `outdoor_recreation_sites_inventory` and `sga_phase_2_assessed_reaches` tables.\n\n**Conditions Used:**\n- **`outdoor_recreation_sites_inventory.AH_O1_YN = 'Y'`**: Filters for sites where the AH condition is met ('Y').\n- **`outdoor_recreation_sites_inventory.AI_O2_YN = 'N'`**: Filters for sites where the AI condition is not met ('N').\n- **`INNER JOIN outdoor_recreation_sites_inventory ON outdoor_recreation_sites_inventory.RID = sga_phase_2_assessed_reaches.RID`**: Joins the two tables based on the common `RID` field, ensuring that only matching records are included in the result set.\n\n### Business scenario:\nThis query could be part of an environmental management system aimed at assessing and prioritizing outdoor recreation sites based on certain criteria. For example, the system might prioritize sites for maintenance or further",
  "natural_language_query": "User: I'm working on a project that involves analyzing data on outdoor recreation sites. Specifically, I'm interested in sites that meet certain criteria but do not meet others. I need to find all outdoor recreation sites listed in our database that have a feature marked as present ('Y') under category AH, but lack a feature under category AI. To narrow down my search, I also want to ensure these sites are linked to assessments made during phase 2 of a stream gauge project. Can you help me write a SQL query for this?\n\nAssistant: Assistant: Absolutely, let's structure your SQL query step by step to address your needs. You're looking to identify outdoor recreation sites that fulfill a specific criterion (AH being 'Y') while not meeting another (AI being 'N'), and these sites must be associated with assessments from phase 2 of a stream gauge project.\n\nFirst, we'll define our main table as `outdoor_recreation_sites_inventory`. It seems this table includes information like `OBJECTID`, `SITE_NAME`, `AH_O1_YN`, and `AI_O2_YN`. Your criteria for AH being 'Y' and AI not being 'N' can be directly addressed using these fields.\n\nNext, we'll incorporate the `sga_phase_2_assessed_reaches` table, which presumably contains details about the stream gauge assessments. The `RID` field in both tables should match to establish the link between a recreation site and its corresponding assessment.\n\nHereâ€™s how you can construct your SQL query:\n\n```sql\nSELECT \n    osi.SITE_NAME,\n    osi.OBJECTID,\n    sga.ProjectName,\n    sga.SGAT_ID\nFROM \n    outdoor_recreation_sites_inventory osi\nINNER JOIN \n    sga_phase_2_assessed_reaches sga ON osi.RID = sga.RID\nWHERE \n    osi.AH_O1_YN = 'Y'\nAND \n    osi.AI_O2_YN = 'N';\n```\n\nThis query will return the `SITE_NAME`, `OBJECTID`, `ProjectName`, and `SGAT_ID` for all sites that have AH marked as 'Y', AI marked as 'N', and are linked to phase 2 assessments of stream gauge projects. \n\nMake sure to replace `outdoor_recreation_sites_inventory` and `sga_phase_2_assessed_reaches` with the actual table names in your database, and adjust the field names according to your database schema if they differ slightly.",
