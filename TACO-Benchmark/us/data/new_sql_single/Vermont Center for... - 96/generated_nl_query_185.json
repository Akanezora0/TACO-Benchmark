  "problem_description": "### Query intent:\nThe SQL statement aims to retrieve specific data from two related tables, `wildlife_management_units` (represented by `w`) and `landslides` (represented by `l`). The primary goal is to join these two tables based on a common identifier (`OBJECTID`) and filter the results by specifying an agency name ('YourAgencyName').\n\n### Detailed description:\n- **Table `wildlife_management_units`**:\n  - **Columns**: This table likely contains information about various management units for wildlife, such as their unique identifiers (`OBJECTID`), names, locations, and the managing agency (`AGENCY`).\n  - **Column `AGENCY`**: Represents the agency responsible for managing each unit.\n\n- **Table `landslides`**:\n  - **Columns**: This table might include details about landslide events, possibly including a unique identifier (`OBJECTID`), location, severity, and any associated management units.\n  - **Column `OBJECTID`**: A common identifier shared between records in both tables.\n\n- **Join condition** (`l.OBJECTID = w.OBJECTID`): This condition ensures that only those landslide events are considered that are associated with a specific wildlife management unit, identified by matching `OBJECTID`s.\n\n- **Filter condition** (`w.AGENCY = 'YourAgencyName'`): After the join, the query further filters the results to only include records where the managing agency (`AGENCY`) matches the specified agency name ('YourAgencyName').\n\n### Business scenario:\nThis SQL query is typically used in environmental management systems where one needs to analyze landslide events within the jurisdiction of a particular agency. For instance, a conservation officer or an environmental scientist might use this query to:\n\n- **Monitor activity**: Quickly identify all landslides managed by a specific agency to monitor their frequency, severity, or any patterns over time.\n- **Resource allocation**: Determine the resources required for maintenance or mitigation efforts specific to the landslides managed by a given agency.\n- **Policy enforcement**: Ensure compliance with regulations by reviewing all landslide events under the agency's purview.\n\n### User description:\nA user, perhaps an environmental policy analyst or a conservation manager, might need to understand the impact of recent or historical landslides in areas they are responsible for managing. By running this query, they can efficiently gather necessary data to make informed decisions regarding resource allocation, policy adjustments, or emergency planning specifically related to landslides managed by their agency.",
  "natural_language_query": "As an environmental policy analyst for YourAgencyName, I often need to assess the impact of landslides in the territories we manage. To do this effectively, I frequently run queries to gather detailed information on all landslide events within our jurisdiction. \n\nSpecifically, I am interested in retrieving comprehensive data on landslides that occurred in the areas under the management of YourAgencyName. My goal is to not only identify these events but also to understand their nature, severity, and any preventive measures taken. \n\nTo achieve this, I would formulate a SQL query like so:\n\n```\nSELECT w.*, l.* \nFROM wildlife_management_units w \nJOIN landslides l ON w.OBJECTID = l.OBJECTID \nWHERE w.AGENCY = 'YourAgencyName';\n```\n\nThis query is designed to join the `wildlife_management_units` table (represented by `w`) with the `landslides` table (represented by `l`) based on a common identifier (`OBJECTID`). It then filters the joined dataset to include only those records where the managing agency (`AGENCY`) is 'YourAgencyName'. The result is a comprehensive list of landslides managed by our agency, providing invaluable insights into our environmental responsibilities and potential areas needing attention or intervention.",
