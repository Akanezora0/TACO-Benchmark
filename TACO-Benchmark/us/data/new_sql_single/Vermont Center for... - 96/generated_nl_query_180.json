  "problem_description": "### Query intent:\nThe SQL statement aims to retrieve specific geographic coordinates (latitude and longitude) and the full address associated with storage records that are located within the United States and have not been remediated.\n\n### Detailed description:\n1. **Table**: `salt_storage_record_table` - This table likely contains records related to storage locations, including details such as the full address, unique identifier (`OBJECTID`), and possibly more information about each storage location.\n2. **Column**:\n   - `address_full`: The full address of the storage location.\n   - `landslides.X`: The longitude coordinate of the storage location.\n   - `landslides.Y`: The latitude coordinate of the storage location.\n3. **Join**: The `JOIN` clause connects `salt_storage_record_table` with another table (`landslides`) based on the common column `OBJECTID`. This suggests that there might be additional geographic data stored in the `landslides` table, which is being linked back to the storage records for geographical referencing.\n4. **Conditions**:\n   - `salt_storage_record_table.address_country = 'US'`: Filters the records to only include those where the country of the storage location is the United States.\n   - `landslides.REMEDIATED = 'No'`: Filters the records further to exclude any storage locations that have been remediated, meaning they have undergone some form of environmental cleanup or restoration.\n\n### Business scenario:\nThis query could be used in a scenario where an environmental or compliance team needs to monitor or inspect unremediated storage facilities located within the United States. For example, if there's a need to ensure that all hazardous materials are properly contained and managed, especially those that are not yet part of a remediation plan, this query would help identify the relevant facilities for review.\n\n### User description:\nA user, perhaps from an environmental regulation agency or a corporate compliance department, might use this query when they need to conduct audits or inspections of storage facilities that store potentially hazardous materials. The query helps them focus on facilities that are in the United States and have not yet undergone any remediation efforts, indicating that these facilities may require immediate attention or action to ensure they comply with environmental regulations.",
  "natural_language_query": "A user, possibly from an environmental compliance department, might want to run a query to identify specific details about storage facilities that hold potentially hazardous materials. The goal is to find out about any issues that need urgent attention at facilities located within the United States and that haven't been addressed through any remediation efforts. To achieve this, the user would formulate a SQL query like:\n\n```sql\nSELECT salt_storage_record_table.address_full, \n       landslides.X AS longitude, \n       landslides.Y AS latitude \nFROM salt_storage_record_table \nJOIN landslides ON salt_storage_record_table.OBJECTID = landslides.OBJECTID \nWHERE salt_storage_record_table.address_country = 'US' \nAND landslides.REMEDIATED = 'No';\n```\n\nThis query serves the purpose of gathering crucial information about storage facilities that are situated in the United States and are currently not undergoing any cleanup processes. The data includes the full address of the facility, its longitude and latitude coordinates, which can be essential for conducting site visits or further environmental assessments. By identifying these facilities, the compliance department can prioritize their inspection schedules to ensure that all hazardous materials are appropriately managed and stored according to environmental regulations.",
