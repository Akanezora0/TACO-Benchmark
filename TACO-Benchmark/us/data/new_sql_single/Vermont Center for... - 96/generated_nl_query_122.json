  "problem_description": "### Query intent:\nThe SQL statement is designed to extract specific information from two related tables: `sand_and_gravel_deposits` and `wildlife_management_units`. The main goal is to find details about sand and gravel deposits that have been classified as 'Quarry' type, specifically those that are managed by the agency known as 'DNR'. \n\n### Detailed description:\n- **Table `sand_and_gravel_deposits`**:\n    - `OBJECTID`: This column serves as a unique identifier for each sand and gravel deposit entry.\n    - `AG_TYPE`: A categorical column indicating the type of the deposit, here it filters for 'Quarry' types.\n\n- **Table `wildlife_management_units`**:\n    - `ABNAME`: Abbreviated name of the wildlife management unit where the deposit might be located.\n    - `OBJECTID`: A unique identifier matching with `sand_and_gravel_deposits.OBJECTID` through an INNER JOIN, ensuring only records with matching deposit IDs are considered.\n    - `AGENCY`: The managing agency of the wildlife management unit, which filters for entries managed by 'DNR'.\n\n- **Join condition**:\n    `sand_and_gravel_deposits.GlobalID = wildlife_management_units.OBJECTID` ensures that only those sand and gravel deposits with corresponding wildlife management units are included in the result set.\n\n- **Where clause**:\n    `sand_and_gravel_deposits.AG_TYPE = 'Quarry'` filters for quarry-type deposits.\n    `wildlife_management_units.AGENCY = 'DNR'` narrows down the results to those managed by the Department of Natural Resources (DNR).\n\n### Business scenario:\nThis query is useful in environmental management or resource allocation contexts, particularly when there's a need to understand the relationship between sand and gravel extraction sites (classified as 'Quarry') and the land management areas they fall under. It helps in assessing the potential impact of mining activities on protected or managed wildlife habitats, ensuring compliance with regulations regarding land use and conservation.\n\n### User description:\nA user, perhaps an environmental scientist or a government regulator, might need this information to:\n- Evaluate the compatibility of mining operations with existing wildlife conservation efforts.\n- Plan mitigation strategies for the affected wildlife habitats.\n- Ensure that mining activities are conducted within the boundaries managed by the DNR, adhering to environmental protection guidelines.\n- Conduct impact assessments on biodiversity in areas around quarry sites.\n- Update databases or reports on the status of natural resources and protected areas.",
  "natural_language_query": "User Inquiry:\nHello,\n\nI'm conducting a study on the environmental impact of sand and gravel extraction activities in our state. Specifically, I'm interested in understanding how these activities are managed in terms of compliance with wildlife conservation policies. Could you help me retrieve data on sand and gravel deposits that have been classified as 'Quarry' type, focusing on those that are being handled by the Department of Natural Resources (DNR)?\n\nI'm looking to gather information on the locations of these quarries, including the names of the wildlife management units where they are situated, and any other relevant details that could assist in evaluating their environmental impact. This data will be crucial for my analysis on how mining activities interact with conservation efforts in our state.\n\nPlease provide me with the necessary details so that I can proceed with my research effectively. Thank you for your assistance.\n\nBest regards,\n[Your Name]",
