  "problem_description": "### Query intent:\nThe SQL statement aims to retrieve specific data from a table named `landslides`. The intent is likely to gather details related to landslide occurrences, potentially for analysis, reporting, or further processing.\n\n### Detailed description:\n- **Table**: `landslides` - This is the main table from which the data is being retrieved. It presumably contains records about various landslide events.\n- **Columns**:\n  - `\"landslides.X\"`: This refers to a column in the `landslides` table, named `X`. The exact nature of this column is not specified but could represent any variable relevant to the study of landslides, such as location coordinates, event severity, date, or any other measurable characteristic.\n  - `\"landslides.Y\"`: Similarly, this refers to another column in the `landslides` table, named `Y`. Its specifics depend on the context of the dataset, but it could be another variable like a second location coordinate, a different measure of event severity, or another relevant characteristic.\n- **Condition**: `\"landslides.OBJECTID\" = 1` - This condition filters the rows in the `landslides` table based on the `OBJECTID` column. Assuming `OBJECTID` is a unique identifier for each row (or record) in the `landslides` table, this condition specifically selects the row where `OBJECTID` equals 1.\n\n### Business scenario:\nThis SQL statement could be used in a variety of business scenarios related to environmental monitoring, disaster management, or geographic information systems (GIS). For instance:\n\n- **Environmental Monitoring**: Scientists or researchers might use this query to analyze specific details of a single landslide event to understand its characteristics, impacts, or triggers.\n- **Disaster Management**: Emergency response teams could use such data to quickly assess the status of a particular landslide, helping in immediate decision-making regarding safety measures, evacuation routes, or resource allocation.\n- **GIS Analysis**: GIS professionals might employ this query to integrate detailed landslide data with other spatial datasets, such as topography or population density, to conduct comprehensive risk assessments or predictive modeling.\n\n### User description:\nA user might need to access specific data points about a single landslide event for various purposes, including but not limited to:\n- **Research**: To conduct detailed studies on the causes, effects, or potential mitigation strategies for a particular landslide.\n- **Reporting**: To compile reports on the state of landslides within a specific area or region, focusing on a known event for comparative analysis.\n- **Emergency Response Planning**:",
  "natural_language_query": "I'm trying to pull out specific information from a database table called 'landslides'. I'm interested in details related to landslide occurrences, possibly for a research project or to inform emergency response planning. I want to look at data associated with a particular event, identified by an 'OBJECTID' value of 1. Specifically, I'm interested in two attributes from the 'landslides' table: one is labeled 'X', and the other is labeled 'Y'. Could you help me fetch these attributes for that specific event?",
