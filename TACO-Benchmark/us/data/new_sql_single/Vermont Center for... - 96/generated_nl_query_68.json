  "problem_description": "### Query intent:\nThe SQL statement is designed to extract specific geographic coordinates (latitude and longitude) from two related databases: `public_water_sources` and `landslides`. The primary goal is to find the locations where landslides have occurred, specifically focusing on those areas that have been visited during field visits.\n\n### Detailed description:\n1. **Table `public_water_sources`**:\n   - **Columns**: `WSID`, `X`, `Y`. `WSID` is the identifier for water sources, `X` represents longitude, and `Y` represents latitude.\n\n2. **Table `landslides`**:\n   - **Columns**: `OBJECTID`, `FIELD_VISIT`. `OBJECTID` uniquely identifies landslide events, and `FIELD_VISIT` is a boolean or string value indicating whether a field visit was conducted at that location.\n\n3. **Join Condition**: `public_water_sources.WSID = landslides.OBJECTID`\n   - This condition ensures that only rows from `public_water_sources` that match with a row in `landslides` based on `WSID` (`OBJECTID`) are included in the result set.\n\n4. **Filtering Condition**: `landslides.FIELD_VISIT = 'Yes'`\n   - This condition filters out all landslide records except those where a field visit has been made ('Yes'), ensuring that only visited landslide locations are returned along with their corresponding water source coordinates.\n\n### Business scenario:\nIn environmental monitoring and disaster management, this query can be crucial for several applications:\n- **Post-Disaster Assessment**: After a landslide event, this query helps locate the exact coordinates of the affected areas that were visited by field teams for assessment purposes. This information is vital for immediate response planning, resource allocation, and damage evaluation.\n- **Risk Mapping**: By integrating this data with historical landslide occurrences and environmental factors, experts can map high-risk zones and develop strategies for prevention and mitigation.\n\n### User description:\nUsers might need this information when they are tasked with conducting a detailed analysis of recent landslide incidents. For example, an environmental scientist or a disaster management officer might require precise coordinates of landslide-affected areas that were visited during field expeditions to gather first-hand data about the extent of damage, assess the effectiveness of early warning systems, or plan future interventions. The query facilitates quick access to relevant data, streamlining the decision-making process and enhancing the efficiency of response efforts.",
  "natural_language_query": "To address the business scenario outlined, I would formulate the following SQL query as a natural language query:\n\n\"Retrieve the precise geographic locations, including latitude and longitude, of all landslides that have been personally visited by field teams for assessment. This should include identifying the specific water sources found in these landslide-affected areas, which could potentially be impacted or contribute to the occurrence of such events.\"",
