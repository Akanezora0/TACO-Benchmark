  "problem_description": "### Query intent:\nThe SQL statement aims to retrieve specific data from two related tables, `outdoor_recreation_sites_inventory` and `invasive_species`, based on matching site names.\n\n### Detailed description:\n- **Table `outdoor_recreation_sites_inventory`**:\n    - **Columns**: `OBJECTID` (unique identifier for each record), `SITE_NAME` (name of the recreation site).\n    - **Role**: This table contains information about various outdoor recreation sites, including their unique identifiers and site names.\n\n- **Table `invasive_species`**:\n    - **Columns**: `ObservationID` (unique identifier for each observation of an invasive species), `SiteName` (name of the site where the invasive species was observed).\n    - **Role**: This table holds records of observations of invasive species across different sites, including unique observation identifiers and the site names where these observations were made.\n\n- **Join condition**: `outdoor_recreation_sites_inventory.SITE_NAME = invasive_species.SiteName`.\n    - **Purpose**: The join is performed based on matching site names between the two tables, ensuring that only records of invasive species observations at specific outdoor recreation sites are considered.\n\n- **Where clause**: `outdoor_recreation_sites_inventory.SITE_NAME = 'ExampleSite'`.\n    - **Purpose**: Filters the joined result set to include only those records where the site name matches 'ExampleSite', focusing the query output to observations made at this particular site.\n\n### Business scenario:\nThis SQL query could be part of a system designed to monitor and manage invasive species in public recreational areas. It might be used by environmental scientists, park managers, or conservationists to analyze the presence and distribution of invasive species at a specific location, such as 'ExampleSite'. The data could help in planning targeted interventions, assessing the impact of invasive species on local ecosystems, and guiding resource allocation for conservation efforts.\n\n### User description:\nA user, possibly a park ranger or an environmental scientist, might need to quickly access and analyze data regarding invasive species at a specific site to understand the species diversity, potential threats to native flora and fauna, and to plan effective control measures. The query allows for the retrieval of detailed information on invasive species observations directly linked to the specific site of interest, facilitating more informed decision-making in conservation strategies.",
  "natural_language_query": "As a park manager tasked with monitoring and managing invasive species at our popular recreational site named \"ExampleSite\", I need to efficiently gather data on any occurrences of invasive species at this location. Specifically, I am looking to extract details on the invasive species found, their specific locations within the site, and any relevant observations recorded. This information will assist in our ongoing efforts to understand the ecological impacts, plan targeted interventions, and develop effective conservation strategies.\n\nTo achieve this, I would like to run a SQL query that combines data from two databases: one containing comprehensive information about all outdoor recreation sites (\"outdoor_recreation_sites_inventory\") and another detailing observations of invasive species across various sites (\"invasive_species\"). By joining these databases based on matching site names, we can focus on the data relevant to \"ExampleSite\".\n\nMy SQL query would look something like this:\n\n```sql\nSELECT *\nFROM outdoor_recreation_sites_inventory\nJOIN invasive_species\nON outdoor_recreation_sites_inventory.SITE_NAME = invasive_species.SiteName\nWHERE outdoor_recreation_sites_inventory.SITE_NAME = 'ExampleSite';\n```\n\nExecuting this query should provide me with a comprehensive list of invasive species that have been observed at \"ExampleSite\", along with additional details such as the exact location within the site where each observation was made. This data will be invaluable for our team in understanding the current state of invasive species at this particular site and in making informed decisions about future management actions.",
