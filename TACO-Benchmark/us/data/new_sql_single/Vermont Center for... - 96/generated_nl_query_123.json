  "problem_description": "### Query intent:\nThe SQL statement aims to retrieve specific information from two related tables: `landfills` and `salt_storage_record_table`. It seeks to find records where the status of the landfill is 'Active', the material type stored is 'Salt', and the storage duration exceeds 5 years.\n\n### Detailed description:\n- **Tables involved**:\n    - `landfills`: This table contains data about landfills, including an identifier column `OBJECTID`.\n    - `salt_storage_record_table`: This table records information about the storage of salt, including identifiers for the location (`fulcrum_id`) and details about the material stored (`material_type`, `storage_length_years`).\n- **Columns involved**:\n    - From `landfills`: `OBJECTID`, `PSINUM`.\n    - From `salt_storage_record_table`: `address_full`.\n- **Conditions**:\n    - The join condition is based on matching `OBJECTID` (from `landfills`) with `fulcrum_id` (from `salt_storage_record_table`).\n    - Filtering criteria include:\n        - `landfills.STATUS` must be 'Active'.\n        - `salt_storage_record_table.material_type` must be 'Salt'.\n        - `salt_storage_record_table.storage_length_years` must be greater than 5.\n\n### Business scenario:\nThis query can be utilized in environmental management and planning contexts. For instance, it might help in identifying active landfills that are currently storing salt and have been doing so for more than 5 years. This information could be crucial for regulatory compliance checks, assessing environmental impact, or planning for the decommissioning or future use of these sites.\n\n### User description:\nA user, possibly an environmental regulator or a site manager, might need this information to ensure that certain landfills are being managed properly according to regulations. Specifically, they might want to know which active landfills are storing salt for a long duration, as this could affect water quality, soil health, and require special handling or monitoring measures.",
  "natural_language_query": "As an environmental regulator tasked with ensuring compliance and safety standards at various facilities, I am seeking detailed information on landfills that are currently operational and storing salt for an extended period. Specifically, I am interested in identifying any active landfills within our jurisdiction where salt has been stored for over five years. This inquiry is crucial for our ongoing efforts to monitor environmental impacts and ensure adherence to legal requirements governing waste management and pollution control. To facilitate this investigation, I would like to access data from two interconnected databases: the `landfills` table, which contains general information about each landfill, and the `salt_storage_record_table`, which logs the specifics of salt storage activities. The key fields I aim to extract are `OBJECTID` and `PSINUM` from the `landfills` table, along with the `address_full` details from the `salt_storage_record_table`. These pieces of information will enable us to pinpoint the exact locations of these facilities, understand their operational status, and evaluate the duration of salt storage, thereby informing our regulatory actions and environmental assessments.",
