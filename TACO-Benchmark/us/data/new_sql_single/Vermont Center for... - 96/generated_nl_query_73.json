  "problem_description": "### Query intent:\nThe SQL statement aims to retrieve specific data from two related tables, `landfills` and `outdoor_recreation_sites_inventory`, focusing on records where the status of the landfills is 'Active'. The output includes unique identifiers (`OBJECTID`) and names (`SITENAME` and `SITE_NAME`) for both types of locations, as well as the most recent date (`DATE_LAST`) for each landfill.\n\n### Detailed description:\n- **Tables Involved**: \n  - `landfills`: This table likely contains information about landfills, including their unique identifier (`OBJECTID`), name (`SITENAME`), latitude, longitude, and status (`STATUS`).\n  - `outdoor_recreation_sites_inventory`: This table contains information about outdoor recreation sites, with a unique identifier (`OBJECTID`), site name (`SITE_NAME`), and possibly location coordinates (latitude and longitude).\n\n- **Columns Selected**:\n  - From `landfills`: `OBJECTID`, `SITENAME`, and `DATE_LAST`.\n  - From `outdoor_recreation_sites_inventory`: `OBJECTID`, `SITE_NAME`.\n\n- **Conditions**:\n  - **Inner Join**: Requires that the latitude and longitude values between the `landfills` and `outdoor_recreation_sites_inventory` tables match exactly, implying these sites are co-located.\n  - **WHERE clause**: Filters for only those rows where the `STATUS` column in the `landfills` table is set to 'Active', indicating operational landfills.\n\n- **Sorting**:\n  - `ORDER BY landfills.DATE_LAST DESC`: Orders the results by the last update date of each landfill in descending order, ensuring the most recently updated landfill appears first.\n\n### Business Scenario:\nThis SQL query could be part of an environmental monitoring system or a spatial data management application designed to manage and analyze the status and location of landfills alongside nearby outdoor recreation sites. It might be used to:\n\n1. **Environmental Compliance Monitoring**: Identify which active landfills have nearby recreational areas, potentially requiring additional environmental assessments or monitoring due to potential impacts on human health or wildlife.\n\n2. **Spatial Planning**: Assist in urban planning by understanding the proximity of recreational facilities to operational landfills, aiding in decisions about new developments or conservation areas.\n\n3. **Risk Assessment**: Evaluate the risks associated with active landfills near sensitive environments such as parks or nature reserves, facilitating risk mitigation strategies.\n\n### User Description:\nA user might need this information to:\n- Ensure compliance with environmental regulations by identifying any active landfills",
  "natural_language_query": "I'm looking to gather details on active landfills and their nearby recreational sites for a comprehensive environmental review. Specifically, I want to know the unique identifiers, names, and the most recent update dates for all active landfills. Additionally, I'd like to include the site names for nearby outdoor recreation areas. To ensure accuracy, it's crucial that the geographical coordinates (latitude and longitude) for each landfill and recreational site match perfectly, indicating they are located at the same spot. Could you run a query that pulls this information together, filtering only for active landfills, and sorts the results based on the most recent update date for each entry? This would help me in assessing the environmental impact and planning future activities around these locations.",
