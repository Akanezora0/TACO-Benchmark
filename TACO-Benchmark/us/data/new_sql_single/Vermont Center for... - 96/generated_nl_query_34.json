  "problem_description": "### Query intent:\nThe SQL statement aims to retrieve specific geographic coordinates (X and Y) associated with water sources that are currently operational and available.\n\n### Detailed description:\n1. **Table**: `public_water_sources` - This table likely contains comprehensive data about various water sources, possibly including their geographical locations, operational statuses, availability, and other relevant details.\n2. **Columns**:\n   - `X`: Represents the X-coordinate in a geographical system, typically part of a coordinate pair (X, Y) to denote location on a map.\n   - `Y`: Represents the Y-coordinate in a geographical system, forming the coordinate pair with `X` to denote precise locations.\n   - `SystemStatus`: A column indicating the operational status of the water source, here filtered to include only those that are 'Operational'.\n   - `Availability`: Another column specifying whether the water source is currently 'Available', which could refer to its accessibility for use or service.\n3. **Conditions**:\n   - `public_water_sources.SystemStatus = 'Operational'`: This condition filters out any water sources that are not currently operational.\n   - `public_water_sources.Availability = 'Available'`: This condition further narrows down the results to only those water sources that are available for use.\n\n### Business scenario:\nThis SQL query is particularly useful in scenarios where there is a need to quickly identify operational and available water sources within a certain area. For instance, in emergency response situations where immediate access to water is crucial, this query can help locate functional and accessible water sources near disaster zones or areas affected by natural calamities.\n\n### User description:\nA user might require this information when they need to dispatch resources to areas where water is needed urgently, ensuring that the resources go to water sources that are both operational and currently available for use. This could be relevant for humanitarian aid organizations, emergency services, or local government bodies responsible for managing water distribution systems.",
  "natural_language_query": "I'm working on a project where I need to find out which water sources are currently operational and available for use. Specifically, I'm looking to gather the exact locations, denoted by their X and Y coordinates, of these water sources. Can you help me write a SQL query for this?\n\nHere's what I need: \n1. A table named `public_water_sources` that should contain detailed information about various water sources, including their geographical positions and operational status.\n2. The columns I'm interested in are `X` and `Y`, which represent the longitude and latitude respectively, and `SystemStatus` and `Availability`. `SystemStatus` should tell us if the water source is operational, and `Availability` should confirm if it's currently accessible for use.\n\nMy conditions are:\n- The `SystemStatus` must be 'Operational', meaning the water source is functioning.\n- The `Availability` must also be 'Available', ensuring the water source is accessible for use.\n\nThis query will help me pinpoint the exact locations of operational and available water sources, which is crucial for my project requirements.",
