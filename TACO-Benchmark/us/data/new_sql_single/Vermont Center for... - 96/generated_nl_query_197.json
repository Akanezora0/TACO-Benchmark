  "problem_description": "### Query intent:\nThe SQL statement aims to retrieve specific coordinates (X, Y) from the `waste_water_facilities` table based on certain conditions. It seems to be searching for facilities that match a particular WWInventoryURL while also being associated with records in the `wildlife_management_units` table through their `FacilityID`.\n\n### Detailed description:\n- **Table `waste_water_facilities`**:\n  - Columns: `FacilityID`, `X`, `Y`\n  - This table contains information about waste water facilities, including a unique `FacilityID`, X-coordinate (`X`), and Y-coordinate (`Y`).\n  - The condition `waste_water_facilities.FacilityID = 1` specifies that only rows where the `FacilityID` is exactly 1 should be considered.\n\n- **Table `wildlife_management_units`**:\n  - Columns: `OBJECTID`, `ABNAME`, `AGENCY`, `FacilityID`\n  - This table includes data related to wildlife management units, with columns like `OBJECTID`, `ABNAME`, and `AGENCY` providing details about each unit.\n  - The `FacilityID` column indicates the relationship between this table and the `waste_water_facilities` table, allowing us to link facilities with wildlife management units.\n\n- **Subquery**:\n  - The subquery `SELECT FacilityID FROM waste_water_facilities WHERE WWInventoryURL = 'http://example.com'` selects the `FacilityID` of all facilities that have a specific WWInventoryURL ('http://example.com').\n  - The main query then checks if any of these `FacilityID`s exist as the first element in a tuple within the `IN` clause, along with `OBJECTID`, `ABNAME`, and `AGENCY` values from the `wildlife_management_units` table.\n\n### Business scenario:\nThis query might be part of a system designed to manage and analyze environmental impacts of waste water facilities in relation to protected areas or wildlife management zones. It could help in identifying specific facilities that need further scrutiny due to their proximity to sensitive wildlife habitats or conservation areas.\n\n### User description:\nA user, possibly an environmental scientist or a regulatory officer, might need to find out which waste water treatment plants are located near wildlife reserves or national parks. They would use this query to gather precise locations (coordinates) of such facilities, facilitating compliance checks or impact assessments.",
  "natural_language_query": "As an environmental scientist tasked with monitoring the impact of waste water facilities on nearby wildlife reserves, I'm looking to identify any facilities that might pose a risk to local ecosystems. Specifically, I'm interested in facilities associated with the WWInventoryURL 'http://example.com'. My goal is to pinpoint their exact locations by retrieving their X and Y coordinates. To achieve this, I've crafted a SQL query that will sift through the database to find matching records. Here's how it works:\n\nFirst, I'll select the FacilityID of all waste water facilities that have the specified WWInventoryURL. This narrows down our focus to facilities of interest. Then, I'll cross-reference these FacilityIDs with records in the wildlife_management_units table. This table contains detailed information about various wildlife management zones, including the OBJECTID, ABNAME, AGENCY, and the FacilityID that links it back to the waste water facilities.\n\nBy checking if any of these FacilityIDs exist as the first element in a tuple alongside OBJECTID, ABNAME, and AGENCY values, my query aims to uncover the precise locations of waste water facilities that are in close proximity to wildlife management units. This information is crucial for conducting thorough assessments of potential environmental impacts and ensuring regulatory compliance.",
