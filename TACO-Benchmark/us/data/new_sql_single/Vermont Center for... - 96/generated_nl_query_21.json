  "problem_description": "### Query intent:\nThe SQL statement aims to retrieve specific information from a database table named `wetland_ecologist_districts`. The intention is to select the column `ABNAME` (likely an abbreviation or name of a district) and the column `AGENCY` (indicating the agency associated with the district) where the `AGENCY` is specifically set to '环境保护局' (translated as 'Environmental Protection Bureau' in English).\n\n### Detailed description:\n- **Table**: `wetland_ecologist_districts` - This table is assumed to contain data related to districts (possibly geographic areas) managed or supervised by ecologists or environmental agencies. It likely includes various fields such as `ABNAME`, `AGENCY`, and possibly more.\n- **Columns**:\n    - `ABNAME`: This column represents the name or abbreviation of the district being managed.\n    - `AGENCY`: This column specifies the agency responsible for managing the district, in this case, '环境保护局'.\n- **Condition**:\n    - `wetland_ecologist_districts.AGENCY = '环境保护局'` - This condition filters the rows in the table `wetland_ecologist_districts` to only include those where the `AGENCY` field contains the value '环境保护局'. This means the query is interested in districts managed by the Environmental Protection Bureau.\n\n### Business scenario:\nThis SQL query could be used in various environmental management or planning contexts, such as:\n- **Monitoring and Reporting**: To identify all districts managed by the Environmental Protection Bureau for reporting purposes, compliance checks, or audits.\n- **Resource Allocation**: To allocate resources or personnel to districts under the management of the Environmental Protection Bureau for specific tasks like conservation efforts, pollution control, or ecological restoration.\n- **Policy Implementation**: To track which districts are subject to policies or regulations enforced by the Environmental Protection Bureau.\n\n### User description:\nA user might need this information when they are tasked with:\n- **Preparation of reports** that need to highlight activities or initiatives carried out in districts managed by a specific environmental agency.\n- **Resource planning** for environmental projects that require coordination with districts under the jurisdiction of the Environmental Protection Bureau.\n- **Legal compliance checks** ensuring that all actions within these districts adhere to environmental laws and regulations enforced by the bureau.",
