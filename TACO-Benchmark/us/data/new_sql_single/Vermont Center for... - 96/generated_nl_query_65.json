  "problem_description": "### Query intent:\nThe SQL statement aims to retrieve specific information from two related tables, `river_main_stem_waterbodies_wbid` and `sand_and_gravel_deposits`, based on a common identifier (`OBJECTID`), likely to analyze or correlate waterbody information with sand and gravel deposit data.\n\n### Detailed description:\n- **Table `river_main_stem_waterbodies_wbid`**: This table contains records related to waterbodies along a main river stem. It includes at least the `OBJECTID`, `WBID`, `WBNAME`, and `WBDESC` columns. The `OBJECTID` is presumably a unique identifier for each record in this table, while `WBID`, `WBNAME`, and `WBDESC` likely represent identifiers, names, and descriptions of the waterbodies, respectively.\n  \n- **Table `sand_and_gravel_deposits`**: This table contains information about sand and gravel deposits. It has an `OBJECTID` column, which is used as a foreign key or primary key in this context, linking it to the `river_main_stem_waterbodies_wbid` table via the same `OBJECTID`. This implies that there is a relationship between certain waterbodies and their associated sand and gravel deposits.\n\n- **Condition**: The condition `river_main_stem_waterbodies_wbid.OBJECTID = sand_and_gravel_deposits.OBJECTID` ensures that only those waterbodies with matching identifiers in both tables are included in the result set. This condition facilitates the correlation between waterbodies and their associated sand and gravel deposits.\n\n### Business scenario:\nThis SQL query could be used in environmental studies or resource management projects where the impact of waterbodies on sediment deposition is of interest. For instance, understanding how different waterbodies (like rivers, lakes, or wetlands) influence the distribution and characteristics of sand and gravel deposits can help in assessing potential resources, ecological impacts, or planning infrastructure like dams or bridges.\n\n### User description:\nA user might need this information to:\n1. **Resource Assessment**: Identify areas rich in sand and gravel suitable for extraction, considering the proximity and characteristics of nearby waterbodies.\n2. **Environmental Impact Analysis**: Study how changes in water body dynamics (such as flow rates, sediment transport patterns) affect sediment deposition and the local ecosystem.\n3. **Planning and Management**: Inform decisions on water management practices, conservation efforts, or the design of water-related infrastructure to minimize negative impacts on sediment deposition patterns.\n\nBy querying these",
  "natural_language_query": "As a researcher focusing on environmental impact assessment, I'm trying to understand the relationship between major river water bodies and sand and gravel deposits in a particular region. Specifically, I want to gather detailed information on water bodies along a main river stem, including their names and descriptions, and correlate this with any known sand and gravel deposits in the area. I'm particularly interested in identifying how these deposits might be influenced by the characteristics of the water bodies they're associated with. Could you help me construct a SQL query to extract this information? Ideally, I'd like to see the unique identifier for each water body, its name, and a brief description, alongside details on any sand and gravel deposits linked to it through a shared identifier.",
