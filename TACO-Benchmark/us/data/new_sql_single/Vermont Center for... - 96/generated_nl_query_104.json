  "problem_description": "### Query intent:\nThe SQL statement aims to select specific attributes (X and Y) from a table named `waste_water_facilities` where there is an intersection with another table named `landslides`, based on a condition involving the `FacilityID`.\n\n### Detailed description:\n1. **Table**: `waste_water_facilities`\n   - This table contains information about waste water facilities, including at least one column named `FacilityID` which uniquely identifies each facility.\n\n2. **Column**: `X` and `Y`\n   - These are likely coordinates or positions related to the waste water facilities, possibly representing their geographical locations on a map.\n\n3. **Table**: `landslides`\n   - This table appears to contain information related to landslides, possibly including interactions or impacts on waste water facilities.\n\n4. **Column**: `FacilityID`\n   - This column is common between `waste_water_facilities` and `landslides`. It is used as a linking field to match records between these two tables.\n\n5. **Condition**: `waste_water_facilities.FacilityID = '123'`\n   - This condition filters the rows from `waste_water_facilities` to only include those where the `FacilityID` matches '123'. The same `FacilityID` is then used to fetch matching records from `landslides`.\n\n### Business scenario:\nThis query could be used in environmental monitoring or management systems where the impact of natural disasters like landslides on waste water treatment facilities needs to be assessed. Specifically, it might help identify the geographical positions of a particular waste water facility ('123') that has been affected by a landslide, allowing for further analysis or response planning.\n\n### User description:\nA user working in environmental protection or urban planning might need this information to understand the spatial impact of recent landslides on critical infrastructure, such as waste water treatment plants. This could inform decisions on emergency responses, future infrastructure planning, or environmental impact assessments. For instance, the user might want to know if any waste water facilities ('123') have been impacted so they can assess potential pollution risks, coordinate clean-up efforts, or plan for alternative treatment solutions.",
  "natural_language_query": "As an environmental protection officer, I'm looking into the recent landslide incidents in our region. I need to gather data on the geographical locations of waste water facilities that might have been affected by these events. Specifically, I'm interested in the coordinates X and Y for each facility. Let's say we're focusing on a facility identified by its ID '123'. I want to retrieve all the relevant information from this facility's record in the 'waste_water_facilities' table, as well as see if there's any interaction or impact recorded in the 'landslides' table for the same facility ID. This will help me understand if there were any potential pollution risks or damages to the facility that we need to address immediately.",
