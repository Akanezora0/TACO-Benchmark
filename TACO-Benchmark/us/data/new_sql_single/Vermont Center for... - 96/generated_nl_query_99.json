  "problem_description": "### Query intent:\nThe SQL statement aims to retrieve specific records from two related tables (`salt_storage_record_table` and `wetland_ecologist_districts`) based on certain criteria.\n\n### Detailed description:\n\n1. **Tables Involved**:\n   - **`salt_storage_record_table`**: This table likely contains records of salt storage activities, including identifiers such as `OBJECTID`, `fulcrum_id`, `fulcrum_parent_id`, `fulcrum_record_id`, and `material_type`.\n   - **`wetland_ecologist_districts`**: This table might contain data about ecologists working in specific districts, including `OBJECTID` and `FirstName` (first name) of the ecologists. It also includes an `AGENCY` column which specifies the agency of the ecologists.\n\n2. **Columns Selected**:\n   - The query selects specific columns from both tables: `salt_storage_record_table.OBJECTID`, `fulcrum_id`, `fulcrum_parent_id`, `fulcrum_record_id`, and `wetland_ecologist_districts.OBJECTID`.\n\n3. **Join Operation**:\n   - An `INNER JOIN` is performed between `salt_storage_record_table` and `wetland_ecologist_districts` on the condition `salt_storage_record_table.updated_by = wetland_ecologist_districts.FirstName`. This suggests that the records of interest are those updated by a specific ecologist identified by their first name.\n\n4. **Filter Conditions**:\n   - The query filters results further by specifying two conditions:\n     - `wetland_ecologist_districts.AGENCY = 'ExampleAgency'`: Only records associated with the 'ExampleAgency' will be included.\n     - `salt_storage_record_table.material_type = 'Salt'`: Records must have a material type of 'Salt' to be returned.\n\n### Business Scenario:\nThis SQL statement can be used in a scenario where a company or organization needs to analyze or track the storage and management of salt by ecologists who work for a particular agency. For example, it could be part of a system monitoring environmental conservation efforts, where salt usage might need to be tracked for ecological reasons, such as de-icing roads near sensitive habitats without harming wildlife.\n\n### User Description:\nA user might need this query when they want to:\n- Verify if the correct ecologists are managing salt storage according to the guidelines set by the 'ExampleAgency'.\n- Track the usage of salt by specific ecologists to ensure compliance with environmental regulations.\n- Analyze patterns",
  "natural_language_query": "I'm trying to look into how salt is being managed by ecologists working for the 'ExampleAgency'. Specifically, I'm interested in seeing all the records of salt storage activities conducted by these ecologists. To do this, I want to find out which ecologists are updating the salt storage records and what kind of salt is being stored. Can you help me write a query that retrieves the following information: the unique ID of the salt storage record, the ID of the person updating the record, the ID of the parent record, the ID of the specific record, and the object ID of the ecologist district? Also, I want to filter the results so that only records updated by ecologists from the 'ExampleAgency' and involving salt are shown.",
