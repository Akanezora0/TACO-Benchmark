  "problem_description": "### Query intent:\nThe SQL statement aims to retrieve specific attributes from two tables: `river_main_stem_waterbodies_wbid` and `outdoor_recreation_sites_inventory`. The primary goal is to find details about outdoor recreation sites that have non-null names.\n\n### Detailed description:\n- **Tables Involved**: \n  - `river_main_stem_waterbodies_wbid`: This table likely contains data related to main river stem water bodies, possibly including identifiers (`WBID`) and names (`WBNAME`) associated with these water bodies.\n  - `outdoor_recreation_sites_inventory`: This table holds information about outdoor recreation sites, which could include site-specific details such as `OBJECTID`, `MAP`, `SITE_NAME`, `PUBLIC_PRI`, `BOATING_MA`, and `CAMPING`.\n\n- **Columns Selected**:\n  - `WBID`: An identifier for the water body in the first table.\n  - `WBNAME`: The name of the water body in the first table.\n  - `OBJECTID`: An identifier for the recreation site in the second table.\n  - `MAP`: Information about maps related to the recreation site.\n  - `SITE_NAME`: The name of the recreation site.\n  - `PUBLIC_PRI`: A priority level for public access at the site.\n  - `BOATING_MA`: Information about boating management at the site.\n  - `CAMPING`: Details about camping facilities at the site.\n\n- **Join Condition**:\n  - The tables are joined on the condition that the `OBJECTID` field in both tables must match. This allows for linking water body data with recreation site data based on a common identifier.\n\n- **Where Clause**:\n  - The condition `outdoor_recreation_sites_inventory.SITE_NAME IS NOT NULL` ensures that only records where the site name is not null are returned. This filters out any sites without a named entry, potentially excluding placeholder or default records.\n\n### Business Scenario:\nThis query could be useful in various business contexts, such as:\n\n- **Park Management**: To gather detailed information about specific outdoor recreation sites that have been named, helping in planning, resource allocation, and site maintenance.\n- **Tourism Planning**: To identify and analyze specific sites that offer particular amenities like boating or camping, aiding in tourist attraction management and promotional activities.\n- **Environmental Studies**: For studying the relationship between water bodies and their surrounding recreational sites, potentially for conservation efforts or impact assessments.\n\n### User Description:\nA park administrator might use this query to quickly identify all",
  "natural_language_query": "A park administrator might use this query to quickly identify all the outdoor recreation sites associated with specific water bodies, focusing on those with clear and defined names. The aim is to compile a comprehensive list for better management and planning purposes. Here's how they might phrase their request:\n\n\"I'm looking to gather information on all outdoor recreation sites linked to our main river systems. Specifically, I need details about each site, including its name, location on a map, public access priorities, boating management specifics, and camping facilities. It would be particularly helpful if we could filter out any sites that don't have a clearly defined name. This will assist us in optimizing our resources and enhancing visitor experience across our parks.\"",
