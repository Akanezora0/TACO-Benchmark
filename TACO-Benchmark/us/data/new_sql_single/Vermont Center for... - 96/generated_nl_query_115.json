  "problem_description": "### Query intent:\nThe SQL statement aims to select specific data from two different tables, `river_main_stem_waterbodies_wbid` and `waste_water_facilities`, likely for the purpose of integrating information about water bodies and waste water facilities.\n\n### Detailed description:\n\n1. **Table `river_main_stem_waterbodies_wbid`**:\n   - **Columns involved**: `OBJECTID`. This is the primary key or identifier column for each record in this table, typically used for uniquely identifying each water body in the main stem of a river.\n   - **Purpose**: This table likely contains detailed information about the geographical features, characteristics, or management aspects related to the main stream of rivers, possibly including attributes like water quality, conservation status, or ecological significance.\n\n2. **Table `waste_water_facilities`**:\n   - **Columns involved**: `FacilityName`. This column represents the name of waste water treatment or collection facilities.\n   - **Purpose**: This table probably contains information about various waste water management infrastructure, such as treatment plants, collection points, or disposal sites, which are crucial for environmental regulation and compliance monitoring.\n\n3. **Join operation**:\n   - The SQL statement seems to attempt a cross-table join without specifying a join condition, which is unusual. Typically, such an operation would require a clear relationship between the tables, often defined by matching keys or identifiers. Given the structure described, it's unclear what the intended relationship is between `OBJECTID` in `river_main_stem_waterbodies_wbid` and `FacilityName` in `waste_water_facilities`.\n\n### Business scenario:\n\nThis query could potentially be used in a context where there is a need to understand how waste water facilities interact with natural water bodies. For instance, in environmental impact assessments, urban planning, or compliance checks for industrial waste discharge, understanding the proximity or relationship between waste water facilities and critical water bodies is essential.\n\n### User description:\n\nA user might need this data for several reasons:\n- **Environmental Monitoring**: To ensure that waste water facilities are appropriately located relative to sensitive water bodies, avoiding potential pollution risks.\n- **Urban Planning**: To integrate waste water infrastructure planning with natural waterway management, ensuring sustainable development practices.\n- **Regulatory Compliance**: To verify that waste water facilities adhere to environmental regulations regarding their location near water bodies, ensuring compliance with laws on water protection and pollution control.\n\n### Note on Join Condition:\n\nGiven the lack of a specified join condition in the SQL statement provided, it's important to clarify",
  "natural_language_query": "I'm working on a project that requires integrating information about water bodies and waste water facilities. I want to retrieve data from two tables: 'river_main_stem_waterbodies_wbid' and 'waste_water_facilities'. Specifically, I'm interested in the 'OBJECTID' from the first table, which seems to identify each water body, and the 'FacilityName' from the second table, representing the names of waste water facilities. \n\nMy intention is to understand how these facilities relate to the main streams of rivers. Ideally, I'd like to see if any waste water facilities are located near or impact the water bodies identified in the 'river_main_stem_waterbodies_wbid' table. However, the SQL statement I've seen doesn't specify how these two should be connected. It just mentions selecting the 'OBJECTID' and 'FacilityName' columns but doesn't clarify the criteria for linking them.\n\nIn my scenario, this data would be useful for environmental monitoring, urban planning, and ensuring regulatory compliance. For example, it could help in assessing whether waste water facilities are properly situated to minimize environmental impacts, guide urban development plans that consider both waterways and waste management needs, and verify that facilities comply with laws concerning water protection and pollution control. Could you provide guidance on how to correctly formulate this SQL query to achieve my objectives?",
