  "problem_description": "### Query intent:\nThe SQL statement aims to retrieve specific data from the `outdoor_recreation_sites_inventory` table based on a given `OBJECTID`.\n\n### Detailed description:\n- **Table**: `outdoor_recreation_sites_inventory`\n    - This table is expected to contain information related to outdoor recreation sites, possibly including details about their location, inventory, or other relevant attributes.\n- **Columns**:\n    - `X`: Likely represents the X-coordinate (e.g., longitude) of the site's location.\n    - `Y`: Likely represents the Y-coordinate (e.g., latitude) of the site's location.\n    - `OBJECTID`: A unique identifier for each record in the table, used here as the filtering criterion.\n- **Condition**:\n    - The condition `outdoor_recreation_sites_inventory.OBJECTID = 1` filters the records to only those where the `OBJECTID` is exactly 1.\n\n### Business scenario:\nThis query could be used in various business contexts, such as:\n- **Outdoor activity planning**: Retrieving the coordinates of a specific outdoor recreation site for users who want to plan an activity or visit a particular location.\n- **Site management**: Administrators might use this query to gather information about a single site for maintenance purposes, such as checking inventory levels or updating site details.\n- **GIS applications**: For geographic information systems, this query could help in visualizing and analyzing the spatial distribution of outdoor recreation sites.\n\n### User description:\nA user might need this information when they are:\n- Planning a hiking trip and require the precise location coordinates of a campsite or trailhead.\n- An administrator needs to inspect or update the inventory at a specific outdoor facility and requires quick access to its coordinates.\n- A researcher is mapping out areas for environmental studies and needs to know the exact locations of all recreation sites for their analysis.",
  "natural_language_query": "User: Hi, I'm trying to find some information about a specific outdoor recreation spot. It seems like there's a list of these places in a database, but I only have the ID number for the one I'm interested in. How can I locate it using that ID?\n\nAssistant: Assistant: To find the details of a specific outdoor recreation spot using its ID, you'll want to run a SQL query on the database. Here's how you'd do it:\n\nFirst, identify the name of your database table, which usually contains information about these spots. In this case, let's assume the table is called `outdoor_recreation_sites_inventory`. \n\nNext, you need to know the column names that hold the location coordinates and the unique ID for each spot. Typically, these would be something like `X` for longitude, `Y` for latitude, and `OBJECTID` as the unique identifier. \n\nThe SQL query you'd use looks like this:\n\n```sql\nSELECT X, Y \nFROM outdoor_recreation_sites_inventory \nWHERE OBJECTID = 1;\n```\n\nThis command selects the `X` and `Y` coordinates (longitude and latitude) from the `outdoor_recreation_sites_inventory` table, but only for the row where `OBJECTID` equals 1. This will give you the precise location coordinates of the spot you're looking for.",
