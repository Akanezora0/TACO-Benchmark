  "problem_description": "### Query intent:\nThe SQL statement aims to retrieve specific data related to outdoor recreation sites and landslide events, focusing on those that have been visited for field visits and are categorized for recreation activities.\n\n### Detailed description:\n1. **Tables Involved:**\n   - `outdoor_recreation_sites_inventory`: This table contains inventory data about outdoor recreation sites, including an `OBJECTID` (unique identifier for each site), `SITE_NAME`, and potentially other attributes like location coordinates (`X`, `Y`).\n   - `landslides`: This table holds information about landslides, with fields such as `OBJECTID` (unique identifier for each landslide event), `FAIL_DATE` (date of the landslide event), `FIELD_VISIT` (whether a field visit has occurred), and `ACTIVITY` (type of activity related to the site).\n\n2. **Join Condition:**\n   The SQL statement performs a join operation between `outdoor_recreation_sites_inventory` and `landslides` based on matching `X` and `Y` coordinates, which presumably represent the geographical locations of the outdoor recreation sites and the landslide events.\n\n3. **Where Clause:**\n   - `landslides.FIELD_VISIT = 'Yes'`: This condition filters the results to only include landslide events that have had a field visit.\n   - `landslides.ACTIVITY = 'Recreation'`: This condition further narrows down the results to include only those landslide events associated with recreational activities at outdoor sites.\n\n### Business Scenario:\nThis query is typically used in environmental management or disaster risk assessment contexts. It helps identify specific outdoor recreation sites that have experienced landslides, with particular emphasis on those sites that have been inspected by field experts.\n\n### User Description:\nA park manager or a disaster response team might use this query to:\n- **Identify** sites that require immediate attention due to past landslide events, especially if these sites have been recently inspected, indicating potential safety concerns.\n- **Plan** maintenance or safety measures for these sites, focusing resources on areas where recreation is still allowed but might pose risks.\n- **Document** historical events for future reference in emergency planning, ensuring that all relevant data about past incidents is captured and can inform future decisions.\n\nBy querying this specific information, decision-makers can effectively manage risks associated with natural disasters while also considering the ongoing need for public access to recreational areas.",
  "natural_language_query": "As a park manager or a disaster response team member, I'm concerned about the safety of our outdoor recreation sites following recent reports of landslides. I would like to know specifically which sites have been visited for field inspections and are currently designated for recreational activities. This information is crucial for us to assess risks, plan necessary safety measures, and document historical events for future emergency planning. Could you please provide me with a list of these sites?",
