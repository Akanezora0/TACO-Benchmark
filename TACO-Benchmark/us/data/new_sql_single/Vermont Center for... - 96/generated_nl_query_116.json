  "problem_description": "### Query intent:\nThe SQL statement aims to retrieve specific data from a database table named `waste_water_facilities`. It is intended to fetch the X-coordinate and the name of the facility with a given FacilityID.\n\n### Detailed description:\n- **Table**: `waste_water_facilities` - This table likely contains information related to facilities that handle or manage waste water, possibly including details about their locations, capacities, names, IDs, and other relevant attributes.\n- **Columns**:\n  - `X`: This column likely represents a spatial coordinate (e.g., longitude) associated with the location of the waste water facility.\n  - `FacilityName`: This column holds the name of the waste water facility.\n- **Condition**:\n  - `FacilityID = '12345'`: This condition specifies that the query should only return rows where the `FacilityID` field matches the string '12345'. The `FacilityID` is presumably a unique identifier for each waste water facility in the database.\n\n### Business scenario:\nThis SQL query could be part of a larger system designed to manage and monitor waste water treatment facilities. For instance, an environmental compliance officer might need to access detailed information about a specific facility to ensure it complies with local regulations regarding its location, capacity, or operational status.\n\n### User description:\nA user, perhaps an environmental inspector or a facility manager, might need to verify the exact location and name of a particular waste water treatment facility identified by its unique ID ('12345'). This information is crucial for conducting site visits, inspections, or planning maintenance schedules. By executing this SQL query, they can efficiently retrieve the necessary details without having to sift through large datasets manually.",
