  "problem_description": "### Query intent:\nThe SQL statement aims to retrieve the `OBJECTID` from the `sga_phase_2_assessed_reaches` table where the `ProjectID` is set to '123' and the `URLPage1` field is not null.\n\n### Detailed description:\n- **Table**: `sga_phase_2_assessed_reaches`\n  - This table is the primary subject of the query. It likely contains data related to phase 2 assessed reaches, possibly pertaining to environmental assessments, infrastructure projects, or similar contexts where such detailed tracking is necessary.\n- **Columns**:\n  - `OBJECTID`: A unique identifier for each row in the table. This is typically used for referencing individual records easily and uniquely within databases or GIS systems.\n  - `ProjectID`: An identifier for the specific project associated with each entry in the table. In this case, it's set to '123'.\n  - `URLPage1`: A field that might store URLs or web page identifiers related to the project or reach being assessed. The condition specifies that this field must not be null, indicating that some form of online resource or documentation is expected to be available for each matching project.\n\n### Business scenario:\nThis query could be part of an application or system designed to manage, track, and report on environmental assessments or infrastructure projects. It might be used by project managers, environmental scientists, or regulatory compliance officers who need to quickly access details about specific projects, particularly those that have completed certain phases (as indicated by the `ProjectID`).\n\n### User description:\nA user might need to retrieve all the unique identifiers (`OBJECTID`) for a set of projects (identified by their `ProjectID`) that have undergone phase 2 assessments and have associated online resources documented in `URLPage1`. This could be useful for reviewing project documentation, conducting audits, or preparing reports that require detailed tracking of assessment outcomes and supporting materials.",
  "natural_language_query": "I'm looking to fetch the unique identifiers for all the projects under phase 2 assessments. Specifically, I'm interested in those projects with a ProjectID set to '123', ensuring that they have a valid URLPage1, which means there should be some sort of online document or resource linked to each of these projects. I want to review the details and supporting materials for these projects.",
