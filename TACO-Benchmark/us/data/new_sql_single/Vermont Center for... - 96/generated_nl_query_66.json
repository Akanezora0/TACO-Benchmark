  "problem_description": "### Query intent:\nThe SQL statement aims to retrieve specific attributes related to sand and gravel deposits, including their unique identifier (`OBJECTID`), type (`AG_TYPE`), global identifier (`GlobalID`), area (`SHAPEarea`), and length (`SHAPElen`). It also includes an operation to join data from another table, `invasive_species`, based on a common identifier (`GlobalID`), specifically filtering for rows where the `InvasiveName` column contains the string '指定入侵物种名称'.\n\n### Detailed description:\n1. **Tables involved**:\n   - **sand_and_gravel_deposits**: This table likely contains information about sand and gravel deposits, with fields such as `OBJECTID` (unique identifier for each deposit), `AG_TYPE` (type of deposit), `GlobalID` (global identifier possibly used for cross-referencing with other datasets), `SHAPEarea` (area of the deposit), and `SHAPElen` (length of the deposit).\n   - **invasive_species**: This table contains information about invasive species, with a `GlobalID` field that serves as a common identifier for joining with the `sand_and_gravel_deposits` table.\n\n2. **Columns involved**:\n   - From `sand_and_gravel_deposits`: `OBJECTID`, `AG_TYPE`, `GlobalID`, `SHAPEarea`, `SHAPElen`.\n   - From `invasive_species`: The specific column is `InvasiveName`.\n\n3. **Conditions**:\n   - **Join condition**: `sand_and_gravel_deposits.GlobalID = invasive_species.GlobalID`. This condition ensures that only matching records between the two tables are considered for the final result set.\n   - **Filtering condition**: `invasive_species.InvasiveName = '指定入侵物种名称'`. This condition filters the joined data to only include rows where the name of the invasive species matches the specified '指定入侵物种名称'.\n\n4. **Business scenario**:\n   - **Environmental monitoring**: This query could be used by environmental scientists or conservationists to identify sand and gravel deposits that are affected by a particular invasive species, helping them to prioritize areas for intervention or further study.\n   - **Policy development**: The data could inform policies related to invasive species management, particularly focusing on areas where the impact of a specific invasive species is most pronounced.\n   - **Research**: Researchers might use this information to study the distribution, impact, or potential control strategies for the targeted invasive species across different types of sand and",
  "natural_language_query": "User: Hi there, I'm looking into environmental issues in our region. Specifically, I'm interested in finding out if there's any overlap between sand and gravel deposits and the presence of a certain invasive species. Let's say we're tracking a species named '指定入侵物种名称'. Could you help me find all the sand and gravel deposits where this invasive species has been identified?\n\nAssistant: Assistant: Absolutely, I can help you with that. What we'll do is create a query to look at the details of sand and gravel deposits. We want to gather information like the unique identifier for each deposit, the type of deposit, a global identifier for cross-referencing, the area covered, and the length of the deposit. To make it more specific, we'll also join this information with details about invasive species, focusing on those identified as '指定入侵物种名称'. This will help us pinpoint exactly where these invasive species have been found in relation to sand and gravel deposits.",
