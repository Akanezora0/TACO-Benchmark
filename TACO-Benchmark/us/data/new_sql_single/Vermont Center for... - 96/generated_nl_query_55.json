  "problem_description": "### Query intent:\nThe SQL statement is designed to find the intersection between two sets of data: floodway records from `dfirm_floodways` table and outdoor recreation site inventory records from `outdoor_recreation_sites_inventory`. The goal is to retrieve specific details about these intersections.\n\n### Detailed description:\n1. **Tables Involved**:\n   - **`dfirm_floodways`**: This table likely contains records related to floodways, with at least an `OBJECTID` (unique identifier for each record) and a `DFIRM_ID`.\n   - **`outdoor_recreation_sites_inventory`**: This table includes records about outdoor recreation sites, featuring an `OBJECTID` (for uniqueness), and `X` and `Y` coordinates which represent the geographical location of each site.\n\n2. **Columns Selected**:\n   - **`dfirm_floodways.OBJECTID`**: Retrieves the unique identifier for each floodway record.\n   - **`dfirm_floodways.DFIRM_ID`**: Retrieves a specific identifier associated with each floodway record, possibly related to its classification or management.\n   - **`outdoor_recreation_sites_inventory.X` and `outdoor_recreation_sites_inventory.Y`**: Retrieves the X and Y coordinates for each outdoor recreation site, providing their geographical locations.\n\n3. **Join Condition**:\n   - **`dfirm_floodways.FLD_AR_ID = outdoor_recreation_sites_inventory.OBJECTID`**: This condition ensures that only those floodway records are selected where there exists a corresponding outdoor recreation site based on matching `OBJECTID` values. `FLD_AR_ID` might be an alias for `dfirm_floodways.FLD_AR_ID`, indicating a field within the `dfirm_floodways` table that links it to the `OBJECTID` in the `outdoor_recreation_sites_inventory`.\n\n### Business Scenario:\nThis query is particularly useful in urban planning or environmental management contexts. For instance, it could be employed to identify floodways that intersect with or are near outdoor recreation sites. This information can help in assessing potential risks to recreational activities during flood events, guiding decisions on safety measures, or planning for infrastructure improvements that mitigate flood impacts on these areas.\n\n### User Description:\nA city planner or environmental scientist might use this query to analyze flood risks at popular outdoor recreation sites such as parks, trails, or beaches. By identifying floodways close to these sites, they can prioritize areas for risk mitigation strategies, such as setting up warning systems, creating emergency evacuation plans",
  "natural_language_query": "A city planner is tasked with ensuring public safety during flood events at various outdoor recreation sites across the region. To aid in this analysis, they need to cross-reference floodway records with existing outdoor recreation sites to identify any potential risks. Specifically, they are interested in retrieving detailed information about floodways that intersect with outdoor recreation sites, including the unique identifiers for both floodways and recreation sites, along with their geographical coordinates.\n\nTo achieve this, the planner is looking to run a SQL query that combines data from two tables: one containing floodway records (`dfirm_floodways`) and another holding details about outdoor recreation sites (`outdoor_recreation_sites_inventory`). The planner aims to extract:\n\n1. **Unique Identifier for Floodways**: To easily reference and track each floodway.\n2. **Specific Identifier for Floodways**: This could relate to classifications or management details of each floodway.\n3. **Geographical Coordinates of Outdoor Recreation Sites**: To pinpoint the exact locations of these sites.\n\nThe query should utilize a join condition that matches the `OBJECTID` in the floodway records with the `OBJECTID` in the outdoor recreation sites inventory, ensuring that only records where there's a direct correspondence exist in both datasets are retrieved. This will allow the planner to effectively map out areas of concern and develop targeted safety measures.",
