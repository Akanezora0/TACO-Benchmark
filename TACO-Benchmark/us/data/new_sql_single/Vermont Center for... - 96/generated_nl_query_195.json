  "problem_description": "### Query intent:\nThe SQL statement aims to retrieve specific information from two related databases, `sga_phase_2_assessed_reaches` and `outdoor_recreation_sites_inventory`. The primary goal is to fetch unique RIDs (Record Identification) from the `sga_phase_2_assessed_reaches` table and corresponding CO_ADDRESSES (Street Addresses) from the `outdoor_recreation_sites_inventory` table.\n\n### Detailed description:\n- **Tables Involved**: \n    - `sga_phase_2_assessed_reaches`: This table likely contains data about assessed reaches (possibly river segments or trails) within a phase 2 project. It includes a column `RID` for Record Identification.\n    - `outdoor_recreation_sites_inventory`: This table contains inventory data about outdoor recreation sites, possibly including their addresses. It includes an `OBJECTID` column for identification and a `CO_ADDRESS` column for street addresses.\n\n- **Columns Selected**:\n    - `RID`: A unique identifier for each record in the `sga_phase_2_assessed_reaches` table.\n    - `CO_ADDRESS`: The street address associated with each outdoor recreation site in the `outdoor_recreation_sites_inventory` table.\n\n- **Join Condition**:\n    - The `INNER JOIN` clause connects these two tables based on matching `OBJECTID` values in both tables. This ensures that only records where there is a direct correspondence between the two datasets are included in the result set.\n\n- **Filtering Condition**:\n    - The `WHERE` clause filters out any rows from `outdoor_recreation_sites_inventory` where the `CO_ADDRESS` is `NULL`. This means only records with valid street addresses will be returned.\n\n### Business Scenario:\nThis query might be used by environmental or recreation management agencies to gather detailed information about specific assessed reaches that are near or directly connected to outdoor recreation sites. For instance, it could help in planning maintenance routes, identifying potential access points for visitors, or assessing ecological impacts on recreational areas.\n\n### User Description:\nUsers might need this information to:\n- Plan maintenance schedules for river segments that are close to popular hiking trails or picnic areas.\n- Ensure accessibility and safety at recreational sites by knowing the exact locations of infrastructure like bridges or campgrounds.\n- Conduct environmental impact assessments for new developments near natural resources, ensuring compliance with regulations and minimizing negative effects on wildlife habitats and public access routes.\n\nBy executing this SQL query, users can efficiently retrieve the necessary information to make informed decisions regarding resource management, planning, and compliance",
  "natural_language_query": "Hello,\n\nI'm trying to gather some information about outdoor recreational sites and their nearby assessed reaches for a project I'm working on. Specifically, I need to pull out unique Record IDs (RID) from the 'sga_phase_2_assessed_reaches' database table and match them with the corresponding street addresses (CO_ADDRESS) found in the 'outdoor_recreation_sites_inventory' table. \n\nTo achieve this, I plan to use an INNER JOIN operation to connect these two tables based on the matching OBJECTIDs, ensuring that I get accurate and relevant data. Additionally, I want to exclude any entries in the 'outdoor_recreation_sites_inventory' that do not have a valid street address, which is indicated by the 'CO_ADDRESS' field being NULL.\n\nThis query would be incredibly useful for my project as it allows me to identify key points of interest, such as access routes or potential environmental impacts, around recreational areas. For instance, it could help in planning maintenance routes, understanding visitor access points, or conducting ecological impact assessments.\n\nCould you please guide me on how to formulate this SQL query? Any assistance you can provide would be greatly appreciated.\n\nThank you,\n[Your Name]",
