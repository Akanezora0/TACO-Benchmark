  "problem_description": "### Query intent:\nThe SQL statement aims to retrieve specific data from the `landfills` table based on two conditions: \n1. The status of the landfill is 'Active'.\n2. The waste quality monitoring at the landfill is 'Yes'.\n\n### Detailed description:\n- **Table**: `landfills`\n    - This table contains information related to landfills, which likely includes details about each landfill such as its unique identifier (`\"OBJECTID\"`), a unique serial number (`\"PSINUM\"`), geographical coordinates (`\"LATITUDE\"` and `\"LONGITUDE\"`), and various statuses or features (`\"STATUS\"` and `\"WQMONITORING\"`).\n- **Columns**:\n    - `\"OBJECTID\"`: A unique identifier for each landfill.\n    - `\"PSINUM\"`: A serial or identification number associated with each landfill.\n    - `\"LATITUDE\"`: The latitude coordinate for the location of the landfill.\n    - `\"LONGITUDE\"`: The longitude coordinate for the location of the landfill.\n    - `\"STATUS\"`: The operational status of the landfill, possibly including values like 'Active', 'Inactive', etc.\n    - `\"WQMONITORING\"`: Indicates whether waste quality monitoring is conducted at the landfill, possibly with values like 'Yes' or 'No'.\n- **Conditions**:\n    - `\"STATUS\" = 'Active'`: Filters for landfills that are currently active or operational.\n    - `\"WQMONITORING\" = 'Yes'`: Filters for landfills where waste quality monitoring is taking place.\n\n### Business scenario:\nThis query can be used in several business scenarios related to environmental management, regulatory compliance, or public health. For example:\n\n- **Environmental Monitoring**: Environmental agencies might use this query to monitor which active landfills have implemented waste quality monitoring programs, ensuring compliance with environmental regulations.\n- **Operational Efficiency**: Waste management companies could apply this query to identify their active sites that are actively engaged in monitoring to optimize resource allocation or plan for future upgrades or maintenance.\n- **Public Health Assessments**: Public health officials might use this query to assess the health impacts of landfills by focusing on those that are actively monitoring waste quality, potentially affecting air and water quality.\n\n### User description:\nA user, possibly an environmental scientist, regulatory officer, or a waste management professional, might need this information to:\n- Ensure that all active landfills are adhering to environmental standards by conducting waste quality monitoring.\n- Plan inspection routes or prioritize audits based on the locations of active landfills with ongoing monitoring activities.",
  "natural_language_query": "As an environmental professional tasked with overseeing compliance and public health concerns related to active landfills, I'm looking to gather specific information. Specifically, I'm interested in identifying any landfills that are currently operational ('Active') and also have implemented waste quality monitoring ('Yes'). This will help us ensure that these facilities are not only functioning but also maintaining high standards for environmental protection and public safety. Could you provide me with a list of such landfills?",
