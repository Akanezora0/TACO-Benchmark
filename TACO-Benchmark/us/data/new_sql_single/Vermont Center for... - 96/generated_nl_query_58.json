  "problem_description": "### Query intent:\nThe SQL statement is designed to retrieve specific geographic coordinates (latitude and longitude) from two related databases: `landfills` and `outdoor_recreation_sites_inventory`. It aims to find records where the acreage of outdoor recreation sites exceeds 50 acres.\n\n### Detailed description:\n1. **Table `landfills`**:\n   - **Columns**: `LATITUDE`, `LONGITUDE`, and potentially other columns not specified here.\n   - **Purpose**: This table contains geographical data about landfills, including their exact locations.\n\n2. **Table `outdoor_recreation_sites_inventory`**:\n   - **Columns**: `OBJECTID`, `ACREAGE`, and possibly other details about each site.\n   - **Purpose**: This table contains inventory data for various outdoor recreation sites, including their unique identifiers (`OBJECTID`) and the size of the site in acres (`ACREAGE`).\n\n3. **Join operation**:\n   - **Condition**: The join is performed on the common column `OBJECTID` between `landfills` and `outdoor_recreation_sites_inventory`.\n   - **Objective**: To link records from both tables based on matching `OBJECTID`s, allowing cross-referencing of geographic data with site size information.\n\n4. **WHERE clause**:\n   - **Condition**: `outdoor_recreation_sites_inventory.ACREAGE > 50`.\n   - **Objective**: To filter out all records where the acreage of the outdoor recreation site is less than or equal to 50 acres, focusing only on larger sites.\n\n### Business scenario:\nThis query is useful in environmental management, urban planning, or tourism development contexts where one needs to analyze or plan around large outdoor recreation sites. For instance:\n\n- **Environmental Management**:\n   - Identify landfills located near or within large recreational areas to assess potential environmental impacts or opportunities for mitigation.\n   \n- **Urban Planning**:\n   - Plan new infrastructure like roads or public services near larger recreational sites, ensuring they are accessible while minimizing environmental disruption.\n   \n- **Tourism Development**:\n   - Highlight or map large recreational sites that are close to waste management facilities for strategic planning of tourist attractions or amenities.\n\n### User description:\nA city planner or environmental consultant might need this information to evaluate the proximity of landfills to public parks or natural reserves, aiming to understand potential risks and opportunities for sustainable development or conservation efforts.",
  "natural_language_query": "As a city planner tasked with assessing the impact of waste management facilities on local recreational spaces, I'm looking to conduct a detailed analysis of landfills in relation to large outdoor recreation sites. Specifically, I aim to identify any sites where the acreage of outdoor recreation areas exceeds fifty acres. By cross-referencing geographical data from the 'landfills' database with the size information of these recreation sites from the 'outdoor_recreation_sites_inventory' database, I seek to pinpoint any potential overlaps or proximities that could influence environmental concerns or urban planning decisions. My focus is on ensuring that our city's recreational spaces are not only enjoyable but also sustainably managed, avoiding any negative impacts from nearby landfills.",
