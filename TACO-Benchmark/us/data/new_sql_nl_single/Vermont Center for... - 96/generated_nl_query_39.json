  "problem_description": "### Query intent:\nThe SQL statement is designed to retrieve the `WaterType` from the `public_water_sources` table based on a specific condition. This condition involves matching the `WSID` column from the `public_water_sources` table with the `WBID` column from another unspecified table (presumably `lakepond_wbids_and_wbid_segments`) and checking if the `EventType` column from the latter table equals 'construction'.\n\n### Detailed description:\n- **Tables Involved**:\n  - `public_water_sources`: This table contains information about water sources, with at least a `WSID` column that uniquely identifies each water source and a `WaterType` column that specifies the type of water source.\n  - `lakepond_wbids_and_wbid_segments`: This table appears to contain a set of identifiers (`WBID`) that might be related to various segments or parts of water sources. It also includes an `EventType` column, possibly indicating the type of event associated with these identifiers.\n\n- **Columns Involved**:\n  - `public_water_sources.WaterType`: This column is selected by the query and represents the type of water source.\n  - `public_water_sources.WSID`: This column is used as a join condition between the two tables.\n  - `lakepond_wbids_and_wbid_segments.WBID`: This column is also used as a join condition, linking records from both tables.\n  - `lakepond_wbids_and_wbid_segments.EventType`: This column is checked for equality against the string 'construction', which could be part of an event or process related to the water sources.\n\n- **Conditions**:\n  - The `WHERE` clause combines two conditions: \n    - `public_water_sources.WSID = lakepond_wbids_and_wbid_segments.WBID` ensures that only records where the `WSID` from `public_water_sources` matches the `WBID` from `lakepond_wbids_and_wbid_segments` are considered.\n    - `lakepond_wbids_and_wbid_segments.EventType = 'construction'` filters the results further, selecting only those rows where the event type is specifically 'construction'.\n\n### Business Scenario:\nThis SQL query can be used in scenarios where one needs to analyze or track construction activities related to specific water sources. For instance, it might be used by environmental regulators, water management agencies, or construction project managers to monitor the status of water source development projects.\n\n### User Description:\nA user, possibly from an environmental monitoring agency",
  "natural_language_query": "An environmental monitoring agency is looking into potential construction activities near public water sources. They want to identify any instances where construction is happening around water sources, specifically focusing on those that have been officially recognized or registered. To conduct this analysis, they plan to run a SQL query using the following criteria:\n\nThey need to match the unique identifier of each water source (`WSID`) found in the `public_water_sources` table with a specific identifier (`WBID`) listed in another table, presumably named `lakepond_wbids_and_wbid_segments`. The query should then filter out all records where the event type (`EventType`) associated with the `WBID` is marked as 'construction'. The goal is to gather data on water sources that are currently undergoing construction activities, which could be crucial for environmental impact assessments or regulatory compliance checks.",
