  "problem_description": "### Query intent:\nThe SQL statement is designed to retrieve specific data from two tables, `landslides` and `salt_storage_record_table`, with the primary goal of identifying records where the storage duration for salt is exactly 5 years and the material type stored is salt.\n\n### Detailed description:\n- **Table `landslides`**: This table likely contains information related to landslides, possibly including a unique identifier (`objectid`) for each landslide event, among other attributes such as `field_visit`.\n- **Table `salt_storage_record_table`**: This table contains records related to the storage of salt, which includes a unique identifier (`fulcrum_id`) potentially linking this table to another, details about the storage period (`storage_length_years`), and the material type (`material_type`) being stored.\n- **Join condition**: The SQL statement performs an inner join between `landslides` (alias `T1`) and `salt_storage_record_table` (alias `T2`) based on matching `objectid` and `fulcrum_id`. This ensures that only records where these identifiers match are included in the final result.\n- **Where clause**: The conditions `T2.storage_length_years = '5'` and `T2.material_type = 'Salt'` filter the joined records further. Only those rows where the storage duration is exactly 5 years and the material type is salt are selected.\n\n### Business scenario:\nThis query could be part of a system monitoring inventory management, environmental impact assessments, or safety audits in industries that handle large quantities of salt. For instance, in the context of salt storage facilities, it might help identify specific storage periods (5 years) that have been dedicated exclusively to storing salt.\n\n### User description:\nA user in charge of managing a salt storage facility might need to verify if any salt has been stored for exactly 5 years without any contamination or change in its properties. This information is crucial for compliance checks, inventory management, and planning future storage requirements. By running this query, the user can quickly identify relevant records, facilitating timely actions such as quality checks, restocking, or disposal plans as needed.",
  "natural_language_query": "As the manager overseeing a salt storage facility, I am tasked with ensuring the integrity and proper handling of our salt stock. Recently, there's been a need to verify if any salt has been stored for precisely five years without any changes or contaminations. This is essential for our compliance checks, inventory management, and strategic planning. To efficiently address this concern, I intend to run a database query to identify all records within our system that indicate a storage duration of exactly five years for salt. Specifically, I'm looking to cross-reference the storage records with our historical data on landslide events to ensure that no salt has been inadvertently affected by any such occurrences during its five-year storage period. This will allow us to maintain the quality and purity of our salt stock, ensuring it meets all necessary standards and regulations.",
