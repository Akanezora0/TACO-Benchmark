  "problem_description": "### Query intent:\nThe SQL statement aims to select specific attributes from a table named `waste_water_facilities`. The intention is likely to retrieve data related to waste water facilities for further processing or analysis.\n\n### Detailed description:\n- **Table**: `waste_water_facilities` - This table is expected to contain records about various waste water facilities, possibly including their identification codes, facility names, locations, capacities, and other relevant details.\n- **Columns**:\n  - `X`: This column is not explicitly defined in the SQL statement. It might represent an unspecified attribute of the `waste_water_facilities` table, such as an ID, a code, or another identifier.\n  - `FacilityName`: This column represents the name of the waste water facility, which is the primary piece of information being selected by the query.\n- **Conditions**: There are no explicit conditions specified in the SQL statement. This means that all rows in the `waste_water_facilities` table will be selected based on the columns mentioned.\n\n### Business scenario:\nThis SQL query could be part of a larger system designed to manage and analyze data from various waste water treatment facilities. For instance, it might be used in environmental monitoring systems where detailed reports on facility performance, compliance, or operational status are required.\n\n### User description:\nA user, perhaps an environmental engineer or a facility manager, might need this query to generate a list of waste water facilities for auditing purposes. They might want to see a report containing unique identifiers (`X`) and the names (`FacilityName`) of these facilities to ensure they have access to all necessary data for compliance checks, maintenance planning, or performance evaluations. This could also serve as a starting point for more complex queries involving additional filters or aggregations based on facility data.",
  "natural_language_query": "As an environmental engineer, I'm tasked with conducting an audit of our company's waste water facilities. I need to gather comprehensive information on each facility we operate, specifically focusing on their unique identifiers and their respective names. This will help me ensure that we're meeting all regulatory standards and maintaining optimal operational efficiency across all our facilities. To facilitate this process, I require a SQL query that can extract the following two pieces of information:\n\n1. A unique identifier for each waste water facility, often referred to as 'X' in our database.\n2. The name of each facility, which helps in identifying the location and scope of each operation.\n\nGiven this requirement, I would like you to construct a SQL query that selects these two attributes from our 'waste_water_facilities' table. This query should provide a clear overview of our entire waste water facility network, enabling us to systematically review and manage our environmental responsibilities.",
