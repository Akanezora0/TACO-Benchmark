  "problem_description": "### Query intent:\nThe SQL statement aims to retrieve unique locations (X, Y coordinates) associated with both wetland ecologist districts and specific parks and recreational sites.\n\n### Detailed description:\n\n1. **Tables Involved:**\n   - `wetland_ecologist_districts`: This table likely contains data related to wetland ecologist districts, including their geographical locations (X, Y).\n   - `outdoor_recreation_sites_inventory`: This table contains inventory data for various outdoor recreation sites, including their locations (X, Y) and possibly other attributes like site name (`SITE_NAME`).\n\n2. **Columns Involved:**\n   - `X`: Represents the X-coordinate of a location.\n   - `Y`: Represents the Y-coordinate of a location.\n\n3. **Conditions Used:**\n   - **UNION**: Combines the results from two separate queries into a single result set. The first query selects all unique locations from `wetland_ecologist_districts`, while the second query selects all unique locations from `outdoor_recreation_sites_inventory` where the `SITE_NAME` is 'Parks and Recreational Sites'.\n   - **DISTINCT**: Ensures that each location (X, Y) is only returned once, even if it exists in both tables.\n\n4. **Business Scenario:**\n   - **Geographic Analysis**: The query might be used by environmental scientists or urban planners to analyze the overlap between wetland ecologist districts and parks/recreational sites, potentially for conservation planning or spatial analysis.\n   - **Resource Allocation**: For local government or park management, understanding the spatial distribution of resources (like ecologists' work areas vs. recreational sites) could help in efficient resource allocation or strategic planning.\n\n### User Description:\n- **Environmental Scientists**: They might need to identify areas where ecologists focus their work in relation to parks or recreational areas to understand ecological impact assessments more effectively.\n- **Urban Planners**: They could use this information to optimize the placement of new facilities or conservation efforts, ensuring they are located in areas of high ecological value and also accessible to the public.\n- **Park Management**: To plan maintenance schedules, events, or infrastructure development around known ecologist activity zones, ensuring that these activities do not conflict with ecological studies or conservation goals.",
  "natural_language_query": "As an environmental scientist looking to enhance my understanding of the spatial relationship between wetland ecologist districts and recreational areas, I am interested in querying the database to identify unique locations where these two types of areas intersect. Specifically, I would like to know if there's any overlap between the geographical coordinates (X, Y) associated with wetland ecologist districts and those of parks and recreational sites listed in our records.\n\nTo achieve this, I propose a SQL query that combines the data from two different databases. First, I aim to gather all unique locations from the wetland ecologist districts table, which includes the X and Y coordinates for each district. Second, I want to extract the X and Y coordinates for all parks and recreational sites, specifically those named 'Parks and Recreational Sites'. By using UNION to combine these two sets of coordinates, I can then identify any locations that appear in both sets, indicating potential overlap.\n\nHere's how the SQL query would look:\n\n```sql\nSELECT DISTINCT X, Y FROM wetland_ecologist_districts\nUNION\nSELECT DISTINCT X, Y FROM outdoor_recreation_sites_inventory WHERE SITE_NAME = 'Parks and Recreational Sites';\n```\n\nThis query will provide me with a list of unique locations (X, Y coordinates) that are either part of a wetland ecologist district or are specifically designated as parks and recreational sites, allowing me to analyze the spatial relationship between these two categories further. This information could be crucial for future research on ecological impacts, urban planning, or conservation strategies, ensuring that our efforts are both scientifically informed and strategically placed.",
