  "problem_description": "### Query intent:\nThe SQL statement aims to retrieve specific information from two related tables, `wetland_ecologist_districts` and `river_main_stem_waterbodies_wbid`, with the goal of identifying matching records based on certain criteria.\n\n### Detailed description:\n\n1. **Tables involved**:\n   - **`wetland_ecologist_districts`**: This table contains information about districts managed by ecologists for wetlands. It has at least two columns mentioned in this query: `OBJECTID` (unique identifier for each district) and `ABNAME` (name of the district).\n   - **`river_main_stem_waterbodies_wbid`**: This table likely contains information about main stem water bodies, such as their unique identifiers (`WBID`) and descriptions (`WBDESC`).\n\n2. **Columns involved**:\n   - **`OBJECTID`**: A common column used as a foreign key linking records between the two tables. It is used in both `wetland_ecologist_districts` and `river_main_stem_waterbodies_wbid` to ensure referential integrity.\n   - **`ABNAME`**: The name of the wetland ecological district.\n   - **`WBID`**: Unique identifier for the main stem water body.\n   - **`WBDESC`**: Description of the waterbody.\n\n3. **Conditions**:\n   - **`wetland_ecologist_districts.AGENCY = 'AgencyName'`**: Filters the rows in `wetland_ecologist_districts` where the agency managing the districts is specified ('AgencyName').\n   - **`river_main_stem_waterbodies_wbid.WBDESC = 'WaterbodyDescription'`**: Filters the rows in `river_main_stem_waterbodies_wbid` where the description of the waterbody matches ('WaterbodyDescription').\n\n4. **Join condition**:\n   - `wetland_ecologist_districts.OBJECTID = river_main_stem_waterbodies_wbid.OBJECTID`: Ensures that only matching records between the two tables are considered, based on the `OBJECTID`.\n\n### Business scenario:\nThis query is designed for environmental management purposes, particularly in scenarios where coordination between wetland ecologists and waterbody managers is required. It allows for the identification of districts that are associated with specific waterbodies managed by a particular agency.\n\n### User description:\nA conservation officer or environmental manager might need to quickly identify which districts within their jurisdiction are directly connected to a specific waterbody being monitored",
  "natural_language_query": "An environmental manager is seeking to compile data on specific wetland management districts that are directly linked to a particular type of waterbody under observation. The query aims to sift through existing databases to find matching records that fulfill these criteria. Specifically, the manager wants to focus on districts managed by an identified agency ('AgencyName') and those districts that are associated with a detailed description of a waterbody ('WaterbodyDescription'). By cross-referencing two databases, one detailing the ecological districts ('wetland_ecologist_districts') and another providing information on the main stem waterbodies ('river_main_stem_waterbodies_wbid'), the manager seeks to ensure comprehensive monitoring and management of environmental resources.",
