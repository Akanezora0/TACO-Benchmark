  "problem_description": "### Query intent:\nThe SQL statement is designed to combine all records from two different tables: `river_main_stem_waterbodies_wbid` and `lakepond_wbids_and_wbid_segments`. The result will contain all rows from both tables without any duplicates.\n\n### Detailed description:\n1. **Table \"river_main_stem_waterbodies_wbid\"**:\n   - This table likely contains data about main stem water bodies (such as rivers) within a specified geographic area or system.\n   - It might include columns such as `waterbody_id`, `location`, `length`, `width`, and `flow_direction`.\n   \n2. **Table \"lakepond_wbids_and_wbid_segments\"**:\n   - This table could contain details about lakes, ponds, and possibly segments of waterways that are not considered main stems.\n   - Columns could include `waterbody_id`, `lake_name`, `pond_id`, and `segment_description`.\n\n3. **`UNION` Operator**:\n   - The `UNION` operator is used to combine the results of two SELECT statements into a single result set. The first SELECT statement retrieves all records from `river_main_stem_waterbodies_wbid`, and the second retrieves all records from `lakepond_wbids_and_wbid_segments`.\n   - By using `UNION`, duplicate rows are removed, ensuring each row is unique across both tables.\n\n### Business scenario:\nThis query is useful for environmental management, urban planning, or geographical information systems (GIS). It combines data about rivers and lakes/ponds into one cohesive dataset, which can then be analyzed together for comprehensive waterway management.\n\n### User description:\nA user working on a project to assess the impact of climate change on water resources might need this combined dataset. They want to analyze the total water body surface area, flow patterns, and potential for flooding across both river systems and lakes/ponds in a specific region. By combining these datasets, they can more accurately model water dynamics and plan mitigation strategies.\n\n### Additional considerations:\n- **Data Integrity**: Ensure that the `waterbody_id` column is unique across both tables to avoid confusion when combining the data.\n- **Consistency Checks**: Verify that there are no inconsistencies in naming or identifiers between the two datasets before combining them.\n- **Data Filtering**: Depending on the business scenario, additional filtering criteria might be necessary to focus on specific types of water bodies (e.g., only lakes larger than a certain size).\n- **Performance Optimization**: If dealing with large datasets",
  "natural_language_query": "As part of an environmental assessment project focusing on the effects of climate change on water resources, I'm looking to combine data on main river systems and lakes/ponds within a designated area. Specifically, I need to integrate information about the length, width, and flow direction of rivers with details on lakes, ponds, and their segments to conduct a comprehensive analysis of water dynamics and potential flooding scenarios.\n\nI understand that by using a SQL `UNION` operator, I can merge the records from two tables: one containing specifics about main stem water bodies like rivers (`river_main_stem_waterbodies_wbid`) and another detailing lakes, ponds, and segments of waterways (`lakepond_wbids_and_wbid_segments`). This operation ensures that the resulting dataset is free of duplicates, providing a clean and unified view of all water bodies in the region.\n\nGiven this context, my natural language query would look something like:\n\n\"I am conducting a study on how climate change impacts water resources in our area. To better understand the overall water dynamics and potential flood risks, I need to combine data on major river systems with information on lakes, ponds, and their respective segments. Specifically, I am seeking to merge the records from two databases: one that provides details on the main river characteristics such as length, width, and flow direction (`river_main_stem_waterbodies_wbid`), and another that contains specifics on lakes, ponds, and their segments (`lakepond_wbids_and_wbid_segments`). My goal is to create a comprehensive dataset that allows for a detailed analysis of water resources, enabling us to develop effective strategies for managing these critical assets.\"\n\nPlease note that while this query is written in English, it aims to capture the essence of the SQL operation described, focusing on the user's needs and the broader business context rather than the technical implementation details.",
