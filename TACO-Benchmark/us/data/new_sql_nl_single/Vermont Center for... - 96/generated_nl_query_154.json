  "problem_description": "### Query intent:\nThe SQL statement aims to retrieve specific data from two tables: `invasive_species` and `salt_storage_record_table`. The primary goal is to fetch the values of columns `X` and `Y` from the `invasive_species` table based on a condition involving the `SiteName` column from this table and the `address_sub_thoroughfare` column from the `salt_storage_record_table`.\n\n### Detailed description:\n1. **Tables Involved**: \n   - `invasive_species`: This table likely contains information about invasive species, possibly including their location (`SiteName`) and some spatial coordinates (`X`, `Y`).\n   - `salt_storage_record_table`: This table seems to record details related to salt storage facilities, with an `address_sub_thoroughfare` field indicating the address or location of these facilities.\n\n2. **Columns Involved**:\n   - `\"invasive_species.X\"` and `\"invasive_species.Y\"`: These represent the X and Y coordinates associated with a site name (presumably a location where invasive species have been observed or recorded).\n   - `\"invasive_species.SiteName\"`: A field in the `invasive_species` table that identifies the site or location of the invasive species.\n   - `\"salt_storage_record_table.address_sub_thoroughfare\"`: An address field in the `salt_storage_record_table` that could be used for matching locations between the two tables.\n\n3. **Conditions**:\n   - The condition `\"invasive_species.SiteName\" = \"salt_storage_record_table.address_sub_thoroughfare\"` ensures that only records from the `invasive_species` table are selected where the `SiteName` matches the `address_sub_thoroughfare` in the `salt_storage_record_table`. This implies a cross-referencing operation between the two tables based on location information.\n\n### Business Scenario:\nThis SQL query could be part of a larger system designed to monitor or analyze the spread of invasive species in relation to salt storage facilities. For instance, it might help in identifying whether there is an increased presence of invasive species near salt storage sites, potentially due to environmental factors such as runoff or storage practices.\n\n### User Description:\nA user, perhaps an ecologist, environmental scientist, or a facility manager, might need this information to understand if there is a correlation between the location of invasive species and nearby salt storage facilities. This could inform decisions on environmental protection measures, pollution control strategies, or even regulatory compliance checks regarding the proximity of sensitive areas to potential pollutants or contaminants.",
  "natural_language_query": "User Inquiry:\nI'm working on a project that involves analyzing the relationship between invasive species distribution and salt storage facilities in our region. I need to pull data that shows the exact coordinates (X and Y) of sites where invasive species have been found, matched against the addresses of the salt storage facilities. Could you help me write a SQL query for this? Specifically, I want to match the site names from the invasive species dataset with the thoroughfare addresses from the salt storage records. The goal is to identify any potential correlations that might inform our strategies for environmental protection and pollution control.",
