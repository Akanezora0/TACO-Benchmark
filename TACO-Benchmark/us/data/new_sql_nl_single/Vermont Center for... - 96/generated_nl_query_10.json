  "problem_description": "### Query intent:\nThe SQL statement is designed to retrieve specific information from two related tables, `sga_phase_2_assessed_reaches` and `outdoor_recreation_sites_inventory`, based on a condition involving a particular site name.\n\n### Detailed description:\n- **Table `sga_phase_2_assessed_reaches`**: This table contains records related to phase 2 assessments of reaches (potentially referring to segments of a waterway or a similar infrastructure). The columns listed include:\n  - `SGAT_ID`: A unique identifier for each reach being assessed.\n  - `ProjectName`: The name of the project associated with the assessment.\n  - `URLPage1`, `URLPage2`: URLs leading to detailed pages about the assessment results or additional resources.\n  - `ReportList`: A list of reports or documents related to the assessment.\n  - `FinalA`, `FinalB`, `FinalC`: Likely final evaluation scores or conclusions for different aspects or criteria of the assessment.\n  - `CorridorPlanA`, `CorridorPlanB`, `CorridorPlanC`: Plans or strategies for the corridor or segment, possibly related to improvements or management.\n\n- **Table `outdoor_recreation_sites_inventory`**: This table likely contains records of outdoor recreation sites. The column `OBJECTID` serves as a unique identifier for each site.\n- **Join condition**: The query performs a left join between these two tables based on the common field `RID` from `sga_phase_2_assessed_reaches` and `OBJECTID` from `outdoor_recreation_sites_inventory`. This means that all records from `sga_phase_2_assessed_reaches` will be included, even if there's no corresponding record in `outdoor_recreation_sites_inventory`.\n- **Where clause**: The condition `outdoor_recreation_sites_inventory.NAME = 'Central Park'` ensures that only records where the name of the outdoor recreation site matches 'Central Park' are included in the result set.\n\n### Business scenario:\nThis query could be used by environmental or infrastructure management teams to analyze the assessment status of a specific area (Central Park) that has undergone a phase 2 assessment. It allows for a detailed comparison of assessment outcomes with the actual site data, facilitating further analysis or reporting.\n\n### User description:\nUsers might need to quickly access and review all the assessment details for Central Park alongside its geographical or inventory information, such as location specifics or other related sites. This could aid in decision-making processes, compliance checks, or planning",
  "natural_language_query": "I'm looking to gather comprehensive information on the phase 2 assessment for Central Park. Specifically, I need details like the project name, links to more detailed assessment pages, any relevant reports, and the final evaluations across different criteria. Additionally, I want to have access to the site inventory information, including the exact location and any other pertinent details about the park. This will help us in our ongoing efforts to manage and improve the park facilities.",
