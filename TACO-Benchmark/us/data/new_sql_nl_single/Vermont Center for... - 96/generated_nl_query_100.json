  "problem_description": "### Query intent:\nThe SQL statement aims to retrieve specific information from two related tables (`landslides` and `invasive_species`) based on their geographical coordinates, and then sort the results by the date of field visits.\n\n### Detailed description:\n- **Tables**: The query involves two tables - `landslides` and `invasive_species`. The `landslides` table contains information about landslides, while the `invasive_species` table contains data about invasive species. The join operation is performed based on matching `X` and `Y` coordinates (representing longitude and latitude) between these two tables.\n- **Columns**: The selected columns from the `landslides` table include `FIELD_VISIT`, `VISIT_DATE`, `STYLE_FAIL`, `LS_TYPE1`, and `LS_TYPE2`. These represent various aspects of landslide information such as the visit details, date of the visit, failure style, and types of landslides.\n- **Conditions**:\n  - The `JOIN` condition is based on matching the `LOCATION_X` and `LOCATION_Y` fields in the `landslides` table with the `X` and `Y` fields in the `invasive_species` table, respectively.\n  - The `WHERE` clause further refines this condition, ensuring that only rows where the `LOCATION_X` and `LOCATION_Y` values match in both tables are included in the result set.\n- **Sorting**: The final result is sorted by the `FIELD_VISIT` column, likely in ascending order, implying that the output will present the records in chronological order of the field visits.\n\n### Business scenario:\nThis query could be useful in environmental management or geographical studies, particularly when tracking the interaction between landslides and the spread of invasive species in a specific area. For example, it might help researchers understand how landslides affect the distribution of invasive plant species over time.\n\n### User description:\nA user might need this information to analyze the impact of recent landslides on the local ecosystem, specifically focusing on how invasive species have moved into newly exposed areas after a landslide event. This could inform conservation strategies, risk assessments, or ecological restoration plans.",
  "natural_language_query": "I'm working on a project that involves analyzing the effects of landslides on the environment, particularly focusing on how invasive species might be spreading into new areas after such events. I need to gather data on landslides and the invasive species found in those locations. Specifically, I want to know which landslides were visited recently, the dates of those visits, the type of failure, and the types of landslides. To do this, I'm planning to use SQL to join two databases: one containing landslide information (with fields like FIELD_VISIT, VISIT_DATE, STYLE_FAIL, LS_TYPE1, and LS_TYPE2) and another with invasive species data, based on their geographical coordinates. I'm looking for all instances where the X and Y coordinates of a landslide match those of an invasive species presence. After joining these datasets, I'd like to sort the results by the date of the field visit to see if there's any correlation between recent landslides and increased invasive species activity.",
