  "problem_description": "### Query intent:\nThe SQL statement aims to retrieve all records from a table named `landslide` where the column `OBJECTID` has a value of 1.\n\n### Detailed description:\n- **Table**: `landslide` - This is the table from which data is being retrieved. It likely contains various attributes related to landslides, such as geographical locations, sizes, causes, dates, etc., each record identified by an `OBJECTID`.\n- **Column**: `OBJECTID` - This is the primary key column in the `landslide` table, used for uniquely identifying each record. It's a numeric field.\n- **Condition**: `OBJECTID = 1` - The query filters records to only include those where the `OBJECTID` equals 1.\n\n### Business scenario:\nThis query might be used in environmental monitoring systems or geographical information systems (GIS) where specific landslide incidents need to be analyzed or detailed reports are required for a particular incident with an `OBJECTID` of 1. For instance, if there was a significant landslide event on a particular day or location, this query would help fetch all relevant data about that specific event.\n\n### User description:\nA user, possibly an environmental scientist or a disaster management official, might need to review all the details about a specific landslide event that occurred at a known `OBJECTID`. This could involve analyzing the cause, size, impact area, time of occurrence, or any other relevant metadata associated with that event to understand its severity or to prepare for future interventions.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThis SQL query serves as a tool for efficiently retrieving detailed information about a single, specific landslide event from a database, enabling detailed analysis and decision-making based on that particular incident.",
  "natural_language_query": "As an environmental scientist tasked with monitoring recent geological activities, I'm interested in conducting a comprehensive analysis of a specific landslide event that occurred within our region. To facilitate this investigation, I need to access all the pertinent data associated with this event. Upon reviewing our database, I've pinpointed an `OBJECTID` of 1 as being relevant to this particular incident. Therefore, my request is to retrieve every detail contained within the `landslide` table that corresponds to this unique identifier. This will allow me to thoroughly examine the event's characteristics, including but not limited to its magnitude, location, potential causes, and the timeline of events, which are crucial for understanding the dynamics of this specific landslide and informing future prevention strategies.",
