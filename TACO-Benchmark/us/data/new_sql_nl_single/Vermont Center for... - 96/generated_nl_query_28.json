  "problem_description": "### Query intent:\nThe SQL statement is designed to retrieve specific details from two related tables: `outdoor_recreation_sites_inventory` and `wetland_ecologist_districts`. The primary goal is to find information about outdoor recreation sites that fall within a particular wetland ecologist district, as defined by the agency and town.\n\n### Detailed description:\n1. **Tables involved**: The query involves two tables - `outdoor_recreation_sites_inventory` and `wetland_ecologist_districts`. \n   - `outdoor_recreation_sites_inventory`: This table likely contains data about various outdoor recreation sites, with columns such as `X`, `Y` (coordinates), `OBJECTID` (a unique identifier for each record), and `MAP` (possibly a reference to a map or location details).\n   - `wetland_ecologist_districts`: This table seems to contain data about districts managed by wetland ecologists, including columns like `FIPS_CODE` (a code identifying each district), `AGENCY` (the managing agency), and `Town` (the town associated with the district).\n\n2. **Columns selected**: The query selects four columns from the `outdoor_recreation_sites_inventory` table (`X`, `Y`, `OBJECTID`, `MAP`) along with matching records from `wetland_ecologist_districts`.\n\n3. **Join condition**: The `JOIN` clause links the two tables based on the `FIPS_CODE` column in `wetland_ecologist_districts` and the `OBJECTID` column in `outdoor_recreation_sites_inventory`.\n\n4. **Where clause**: The `WHERE` clause filters the results based on the `AGENCY` being 'AgencyName' and the `Town` being 'TownName'. This ensures that only records pertaining to the specified agency and town are returned.\n\n### Business scenario:\nThis query is particularly useful in scenarios where there is a need to analyze or manage outdoor recreation sites within a specific wetland ecologist district. For example, park management, tourism planning, or environmental conservation efforts might require detailed information about available recreation sites within a given jurisdiction.\n\n### User description:\nUsers might face situations where they need to plan new recreational activities, assess existing facilities, or conduct environmental impact assessments within a designated area managed by a specific agency. By executing this SQL query, they can obtain precise coordinates, identifiers, and possibly additional map references for all relevant outdoor recreation sites, facilitating informed decision-making and resource allocation.",
  "natural_language_query": "User: I'm trying to gather data for a project on outdoor recreation sites within a certain wetland ecologist district. Specifically, I'm interested in sites located in the 'AgencyName' district, which covers the 'TownName' area. Could you help me write an SQL query to fetch the necessary details?\n\nAssistant: Assistant: Sure, I can help you with that. You're looking to pull information from the `outdoor_recreation_sites_inventory` and `wetland_ecologist_districts` tables. The `outdoor_recreation_sites_inventory` should have columns like `X` and `Y` for coordinates, `OBJECTID` for unique site identification, and `MAP` for location details. The `wetland_ecologist_districts` table should include `FIPS_CODE`, `AGENCY`, and `Town` fields.\n\nHere's how you can structure your SQL query:\n\n```sql\nSELECT \n    outdoor_recreation_sites_inventory.X,\n    outdoor_recreation_sites_inventory.Y,\n    outdoor_recreation_sites_inventory.OBJECTID,\n    outdoor_recreation_sites_inventory.MAP,\n    wetland_ecologist_districts.FIPS_CODE\nFROM \n    outdoor_recreation_sites_inventory\nJOIN \n    wetland_ecologist_districts ON outdoor_recreation_sites_inventory.OBJECTID = wetland_ecologist_districts.FIPS_CODE\nWHERE \n    wetland_ecologist_districts.AGENCY = 'AgencyName'\nAND\n    wetland_ecologist_districts.Town = 'TownName';\n```\n\nThis query will return the coordinates, object ID, and map references for all outdoor recreation sites within the specified wetland ecologist district, helping you with your project.",
