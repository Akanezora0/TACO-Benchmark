  "problem_description": "### Query intent:\nThe SQL statement aims to retrieve specific data from two related tables: `sga_phase_2_assessed_reaches` and `public_water_sources`. The primary goal is to extract geographic coordinates (X, Y) associated with each reach identified by `RchID` in the `sga_phase_2_assessed_reaches` table.\n\n### Detailed description:\n- **Table `sga_phase_2_assessed_reaches`**: This table contains information about assessed reaches in phase 2 of some project. It includes at least an `RchID` column which uniquely identifies each reach and a `ProjectID` column which identifies the project these reaches belong to.\n- **Table `public_water_sources`**: This table likely contains detailed information about water sources, possibly including their geographic locations specified by `X` and `Y` coordinates. It also includes a `WSID` column, which acts as a unique identifier for each water source.\n- **Join condition**: The SQL statement uses an inner join based on the equality of `RchID` from `sga_phase_2_assessed_reaches` and `WSID` from `public_water_sources`. This ensures that only those reaches with matching water sources are included in the result set.\n- **Filtering condition**: The WHERE clause filters the results to include only those rows where the `ProjectID` is exactly '1'. This implies that the user is interested in data pertaining to a specific project (with ID '1').\n\n### Business scenario:\nThis SQL query can be used in scenarios where environmental studies or management require spatial data analysis, particularly focusing on water sources associated with specific projects. For example:\n\n- **Environmental Monitoring**: To track the location of water sources affected by a particular project (identified by its `ProjectID`) for monitoring purposes.\n- **Resource Management**: For managing water resources efficiently, especially if the project involves activities affecting water quality or quantity.\n\n### User description:\nA user might need this information when they want to understand or visualize the spatial distribution of water sources related to a specific project. This could be crucial for planning mitigation strategies, conducting environmental impact assessments, or ensuring compliance with regulations regarding water resource protection.",
