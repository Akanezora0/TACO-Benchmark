  "sql": "SELECT public_water_sources.\"SystemName\", outdoor_recreation_sites_inventory.\"SITE_NAME\" FROM public_water_sources, outdoor_recreation_sites_inventory WHERE public_water_sources.\"FacilityID\" = outdoor_recreation_sites_inventory.\"OBJECTID\";",
  "problem_description": "### Query intent:\nThe SQL statement aims to retrieve specific data from two related tables: `public_water_sources` and `outdoor_recreation_sites_inventory`. It seeks to match records where the `FacilityID` from the `public_water_sources` table corresponds to the `OBJECTID` in the `outdoor_recreation_sites_inventory` table.\n\n### Detailed description:\n- **Table `public_water_sources`**:\n  - Column `SystemName`: This column likely contains the name or identifier of water source systems.\n  - Column `FacilityID`: This is the primary key for this table, used to link it with other tables containing facility information.\n\n- **Table `outdoor_recreation_sites_inventory`**:\n  - Column `SITE_NAME`: This column likely contains the name of outdoor recreation sites.\n  - Column `OBJECTID`: This is another primary key, used to uniquely identify each record in this table. It's being used as a matching criterion with the `FacilityID` from the `public_water_sources` table.\n\n- **Condition `public_water_sources.FacilityID = outdoor_recreation_sites_inventory.OBJECTID`**:\n  The condition ensures that only those records from both tables are selected where there is a direct correspondence between the `FacilityID` (in `public_water_sources`) and the `OBJECTID` (in `outdoor_recreation_sites_inventory`). This typically indicates a one-to-one relationship where each water source system (`FacilityID`) is associated with one specific outdoor recreation site (`OBJECTID`).\n\n### Business scenario:\nThis query could be used in a scenario where a park management or conservation agency wants to cross-reference information about water sources with the specific outdoor recreation sites they serve. For example, the agency might need to assess the availability and quality of water at different recreational areas, or plan maintenance schedules based on which sites have certain water source systems.\n\n### User description:\nA user from a local government or environmental organization might need to analyze the relationship between water source systems and the outdoor recreation sites they support. They could use this query to identify which water sources supply particular parks or camping areas, facilitating decisions on resource allocation, maintenance planning, or environmental impact assessments.",
  "natural_language_query": "A local government official needs to cross-reference data from two databases. Specifically, they want to find out which public water source systems are associated with outdoor recreation sites. To achieve this, they intend to run a SQL query to match records from the 'public_water_sources' table with those in the 'outdoor_recreation_sites_inventory' table. The matching criteria involve the 'FacilityID' from 'public_water_sources' aligning with the 'OBJECTID' from 'outdoor_recreation_sites_inventory'. This operation will help them understand the distribution of water sources around various outdoor recreational areas, aiding in planning maintenance, resource allocation, and environmental assessments.",
