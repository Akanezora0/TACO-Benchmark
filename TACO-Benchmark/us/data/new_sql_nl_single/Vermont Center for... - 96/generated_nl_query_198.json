  "problem_description": "### Query intent:\nThe SQL statement aims to retrieve specific information from the `river_main_stem_waterbodies_wbid` table based on an object ID found in another table (`wildlife_management_units`).\n\n### Detailed description:\n1. **Table `river_main_stem_waterbodies_wbid`**:\n   - **Columns**:\n     - `OBJECTID`: A unique identifier for each record in this table.\n     - `WBID`: An identifier related to water bodies.\n     - `WBNAME`: The name of the water body.\n   - **Purpose**: This table likely contains detailed information about main stem water bodies, such as their identifiers, names, etc.\n\n2. **Table `wildlife_management_units`**:\n   - **Columns**:\n     - `OBJECTID`: A unique identifier for records in this table.\n     - `ABNAME`: Abbreviation or name of wildlife management units.\n   - **Purpose**: This table might contain information about wildlife management units, which could be associated with areas or regions where specific wildlife conservation efforts are implemented.\n\n3. **Condition**:\n   - The query selects rows from `river_main_stem_waterbodies_wbid` where the `OBJECTID` matches the `OBJECTID` from a subquery. This subquery retrieves the `OBJECTID` from `wildlife_management_units` where `ABNAME` is 'example_value'.\n   - This implies there's a relationship between the `OBJECTID` in `river_main_stem_waterbodies_wbid` and `wildlife_management_units`, possibly indicating that certain water bodies are managed by specific wildlife management units.\n\n### Business scenario:\nThis query is useful in environmental or wildlife management contexts where the connection between geographical features (like water bodies) and the entities responsible for their management (wildlife management units) is of interest. For instance:\n\n- **Scenario 1: Environmental Monitoring**:\n  - An environmental agency might use this query to identify all water bodies within a specific wildlife management unit for targeted monitoring or assessment.\n  - **User description**: \"We need to know all the water bodies under our wildlife management jurisdiction so we can plan our environmental surveys and conservation efforts.\"\n\n- **Scenario 2: Wildlife Conservation Planning**:\n  - Conservation planners could utilize this query to find water bodies associated with a particular wildlife management unit to understand the habitat needs and potential threats to local wildlife populations.\n  - **User description**: \"We are planning a new conservation project and need to know which water bodies fall under our wildlife management",
  "natural_language_query": "User: I'm working on a project for my environmental science class, and we're trying to gather data on water bodies that are under the management of a specific wildlife reserve. The reserve is called 'Example Value'. Could you help me write a SQL query to find all the water bodies within this reserve?\n\nAssistant: Assistant: Sure, to address your request, we'll construct a SQL query that leverages the relationship between the `river_main_stem_waterbodies_wbid` table and the `wildlife_management_units` table. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```sql\nSELECT \n    river_main_stem_waterbodies_wbid.WBID,\n    river_main_stem_waterbodies_wbid.WBNAME\nFROM \n    river_main_stem_waterbodies_wbid\nJOIN \n    (SELECT OBJECTID FROM wildlife_management_units WHERE ABNAME = 'Example Value') AS WildlifeUnits\nON \n    river_main_stem_waterbodies_wbid.OBJECTID = WildlifeUnits.OBJECTID;\n```\n\nThis query works by first selecting the `OBJECTID` from the `wildlife_management_units` table where the `ABNAME` is 'Example Value'. It then joins this result with the `river_main_stem_waterbodies_wbid` table on the `OBJECTID` field, allowing us to retrieve the `WBID` and `WBNAME` of all water bodies that are part of the 'Example Value' wildlife reserve. \n\nIf you have any further questions or need assistance with interpreting the results, feel free to ask!",
