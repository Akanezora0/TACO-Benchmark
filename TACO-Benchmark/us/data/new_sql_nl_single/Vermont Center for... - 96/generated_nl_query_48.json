  "natural_language_query": "User: I'm working on a project that involves tracking invasive species in a specific lake, LakeA. I need to find out all the observations made after December 31, 2022, for this lake. Additionally, I want to know more details about the geographical areas covered by these observations, including the exact locations and any treatments applied to control the spread of these invasive species. Could you help me with a query to extract this information?\n\nAssistant: User: I'm trying to analyze the impact of invasive species on LakeA for my environmental science project. Specifically, I need to gather all records from our database that document observations made after December 31, 2022. Furthermore, I'm interested in obtaining detailed information about the geographical extent of these observations, such as the exact coordinates and the total areas affected by the invasive species. Is it possible to craft a SQL query that would provide this data?",
