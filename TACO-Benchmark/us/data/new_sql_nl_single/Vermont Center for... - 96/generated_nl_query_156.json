  "problem_description": "### Query intent:\nThe SQL statement aims to retrieve specific pieces of information from two related tables: `salt_storage_record_table` and `sand_and_gravel_deposits`. It seeks to join these tables based on a common identifier (`OBJECTID`) and filter the results based on a specific condition related to the type of deposit found in the `sand_and-gravel-deposits` table.\n\n### Detailed description:\n- **Tables Involved**:\n  - `salt_storage_record_table`: This table likely contains records about salt storage locations, possibly including details such as addresses (`address_full`).\n  - `sand_and_gravel_deposits`: This table seems to contain geographical data related to sand and gravel deposits, including their areas (`SHAPEarea`) and types (`AG_TYPE`).\n\n- **Columns Selected**:\n  - `salt_storage_record_table.address_full`: The full address for each salt storage location.\n  - `sand_and-gravel-deposits.SHAPEarea`: The area of the corresponding sand and gravel deposit.\n\n- **Join Condition**:\n  - `salt_storage_record_table.OBJECTID = sand_and-gravel-deposits.OBJECTID`: This condition is used to join the two tables together, assuming that each row in `salt_storage_record_table` corresponds to a specific deposit identified by `OBJECTID` in `sand_and-gravel-deposits`.\n\n- **Filtering Condition**:\n  - `sand_and-gravel-deposits.AG_TYPE = '类型值'`: Only rows where the `AG_TYPE` column matches the specified value (e.g., `'类型值'` could represent a specific type of deposit) are included in the result set.\n\n### Business Scenario:\nThis query might be useful in scenarios where one needs to correlate the geographical locations of salt storage with nearby sand and gravel deposits, particularly when there's an interest in the type of deposit (e.g., for potential environmental impact assessments, resource management planning, or logistical considerations related to proximity to raw material sources).\n\n### User Description:\nA user might need this information to plan the logistics of transporting salt to various storage locations efficiently, considering the potential use of nearby sand and gravel deposits. For instance, if certain types of deposits are known to have higher quality or lower environmental impact, the user might want to optimize storage locations based on their proximity to those types of deposits. Additionally, this data could help in conducting comprehensive site assessments or in making decisions about the potential use of the deposits for other purposes, such as blending materials or assessing the",
  "natural_language_query": "A user looking to optimize logistics for salt storage facilities might require a detailed analysis of the spatial relationship between their storage sites and nearby sand and gravel deposits. Specifically, they're interested in identifying any existing records linking these two resources, focusing on a particular type of deposit. The goal is to ensure efficient transportation routes and potentially leverage the proximity of high-quality or environmentally preferable deposits for strategic planning. To achieve this, the user would like to run a SQL query that combines data from two relevant tables: one detailing salt storage locations and another providing information on sand and gravel deposits. The query should:\n\n1. Join the `salt_storage_record_table` and `sand_and_gravel_deposits` tables based on a common identifier, likely `OBJECTID`, which uniquely identifies each record in both tables.\n2. Select specific columns from both tables, namely the full address for each salt storage location from `salt_storage_record_table.address_full` and the area of the corresponding sand and gravel deposit from `sand_and_gravel_deposits.SHAPEarea`.\n3. Apply a filtering condition that restricts the output to only those sand and gravel deposits that match a predefined type, ensuring that the user can focus on deposits that meet specific criteria relevant to their operations or environmental standards.\n\nIn essence, the user aims to identify strategic locations for salt storage based on the availability and characteristics of nearby sand and gravel deposits, facilitating informed decision-making and operational optimization.",
