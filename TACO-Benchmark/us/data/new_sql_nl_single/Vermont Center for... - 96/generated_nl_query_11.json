  "problem_description": "### Query intent:\nThe SQL statement aims to retrieve specific details related to landslides and the corresponding wetland ecologists who observed them.\n\n### Detailed description:\n- **Table \"landslides\"**:\n    - The primary table in this query is `landslides`, which presumably contains information about landslides. It includes at least two columns: `\"VISIT_DATE\"` (the date when the landslide was visited or observed) and `\"OBSERVER\"` (the identifier for the person who observed the landslide).\n  \n- **Table \"wetland_ecologist_districts\"**:\n    - This is a separate table containing information about wetland ecologists. It includes at least two columns: `\"FirstName\"` and `\"LastName\"`, representing the first name and last name of the ecologists respectively.\n  \n- **Join condition**:\n    - The SQL statement joins these two tables based on a specific condition: `\"landslides.OBSERVER\" = '12345'`. This means it's looking for rows in the `landslides` table where the observer's identifier is exactly '12345'. The join uses the `GlobalID` column from the `wetland_ecologist_districts` table to match records with the same identifier.\n  \n- **Where clause**:\n    - The `WHERE` clause further specifies that only rows where `\"landslides.OBSERVER\"` equals '12345' should be included in the result set.\n\n### Business scenario:\nThis query might be used in environmental monitoring or disaster management systems where it's necessary to track which landslides were observed by specific wetland ecologists. For instance, it could help in assigning tasks, analyzing observation patterns, or ensuring that all critical areas have been inspected by qualified personnel.\n\n### User description:\nA user in an environmental protection agency or a research institute might need this information to:\n- Allocate resources for follow-up observations or interventions based on the work of individual ecologists.\n- Ensure compliance with reporting requirements for landslides observed by specific staff members.\n- Analyze trends or anomalies in landslide occurrences associated with particular ecologists or time periods.",
  "natural_language_query": "To retrieve data on landslides observed by a specific wetland ecologist, we need to join two tables: \"landslides\" and \"wetland_ecologist_districts\". The \"landslides\" table contains information about each landslide, including the visit date and the observer's identifier. The \"wetland_ecologist_districts\" table holds details about the ecologists, specifically their first and last names.\n\nWe will perform an INNER JOIN on these tables using the \"GlobalID\" column from the \"wetland_ecologist_districts\" table and the \"OBSERVER\" column from the \"landslides\" table, with the condition that the observer's identifier must be '12345'. Additionally, we want to filter our results to include only those rows where the observer's identifier matches '12345'.\n\nThe SQL query for this task would look something like this:\n\n```sql\nSELECT l.*, w.FirstName, w.LastName\nFROM landslides AS l\nINNER JOIN wetland_ecologist_districts AS w ON l.OBSERVER = w.GlobalID\nWHERE l.OBSERVER = '12345';\n```\n\nThis query will return the details of all landslides observed by the ecologist with the identifier '12345', along with their first and last names. This information can be particularly useful for environmental monitoring, disaster response, or academic research purposes, allowing us to analyze specific patterns or assign tasks based on the work of individual ecologists.",
