  "problem_description": "### Query intent:\nThe SQL statement is designed to extract specific details from two related tables: `landslides` and `river_main_stem_waterbodies_wbid`. It aims to retrieve records where the landslide type (`LS_TYPE1`) is specifically '类型1' and the corresponding waterbody in the river main stem (`WBNAME`) is identified as '主河道名称'. This implies a data retrieval operation with a focus on matching criteria between landslide events and their associated river segments.\n\n### Detailed description:\n- **Tables involved**: The query involves two tables - `landslides` and `river_main_stem_waterbodies_wbid`.\n  - **landslides**: Contains information about landslide events, including unique identifiers (`OBJECTID`), field visits (`FIELD_VISIT`), dates of observation (`VISIT_DATE`), observers (`OBSERVER`), the organization responsible (`ORGANIZATION`), and types of landslides (`LS_TYPE1`, `LS_TYPE2`).\n  - **river_main_stem_waterbodies_wbid**: Provides details about waterbodies in the river main stem, including unique identifiers (`OBJECTID`) and names (`WBNAME`).\n\n- **Columns selected**: The query selects several columns from both tables:\n  - From `landslides`: `OBJECTID`, `FIELD_VISIT`, `VISIT_DATE`, `OBSERVER`, `ORGANIZATION`, `LS_TYPE1`, and `LS_TYPE2`.\n  - From `river_main_stem_waterbodies_wbid`: No specific columns are mentioned, but it's implied that the join uses these tables' common column (`OBJECTID`) for matching.\n\n- **Join condition**: A join operation is performed based on the equality of the `OBJECTID` column between the two tables, indicating a relationship between specific landslide events and their corresponding river segments.\n\n- **Where clause**: Specifies two conditions for filtering the results:\n  - `landslides.LS_TYPE1 = '类型1'`: Filters for landslide events classified as '类型1'.\n  - `river_main_stem_waterbodies_wbid.WBNAME = '主河道名称'`: Further narrows down the results to those associated with the river segment named '主河道名称'.\n\n### Business scenario:\nThis query could be utilized in environmental monitoring or disaster management contexts. For instance, when tracking and analyzing specific types of landslides along a particular river segment ('主河道名称') to assess potential risks, plan mitigation strategies, or conduct post-event impact assessments.\n\n### User description:\nA",
  "natural_language_query": "A database query was constructed to fetch detailed information from two interconnected tables: 'landslides' and 'river_main_stem_waterbodies_wbid'. The objective was to pinpoint records where the landslide category is precisely '类型1', and the associated waterbody within the main river channel is clearly marked as '主河道名称'. This indicates a data extraction process focused on matching criteria between landslide occurrences and their linked river segments.\n\nIn the context of this query:\n\n**Table Involved**:\n- **landslides**: Houses data on landslide incidents, featuring unique identifiers ('OBJECTID'), field visit records ('FIELD_VISIT'), observation dates ('VISIT_DATE'), observers' details ('OBSERVER'), the entity responsible ('ORGANIZATION'), and landslide classifications ('LS_TYPE1', 'LS_TYPE2').\n- **river_main_stem_waterbodies_wbid**: Details the waterbodies in the principal river channel, containing unique identifiers ('OBJECTID') and the body of water's name ('WBNAME').\n\n**Selected Columns**:\n- From 'landslides': 'OBJECTID', 'FIELD_VISIT', 'VISIT_DATE', 'OBSERVER', 'ORGANIZATION', 'LS_TYPE1', and 'LS_TYPE2'.\n- From 'river_main_stem_waterbodies_wbid': Although not explicitly mentioned, an implicit join is assumed using the shared column ('OBJECTID') to link specific landslide events with their respective river parts.\n\n**Join Condition**:\n- An inner join is executed based on the equality of the 'OBJECTID' field across both tables, signifying a connection between distinct landslide events and their corresponding river segments.\n\n**Filter Criteria**:\n- **landslides.LS_TYPE1 = '类型1'**: Filters out landslide instances categorized as '类型1'.\n- **river_main_stem_waterbodies_wbid.WBNAME = '主河道名称'**: Further refines the selection to those linked with the river section denoted as '主河道名称'.\n\n**Business Scenario**:\nThis query could find application in environmental surveillance or disaster response scenarios. For example, in assessing risks, planning mitigation measures, or conducting aftermath evaluations for specific types of landslides along a designated river stretch ('主河道名称').\n\n**User Description**:\nA user might need such a query to systematically gather critical data on landslide events that have occurred along a specified river segment, especially if there is a need to analyze these events in detail for environmental monitoring or emergency preparedness purposes.",
