  "problem_description": "### Query intent:\nThe SQL statement aims to retrieve specific geographic coordinates (X, Y) from two related databases: `public_water_sources` and `wetland_ecologist_districts`. It seeks to find these coordinates for locations where the `TOWN` in the `wetland_ecologist_districts` table matches a specified town name ('Your_Town_Name').\n\n### Detailed description:\n- **Table `public_water_sources`**:\n    - **Columns**: This table contains information about water sources, likely including their geographical identifiers such as `X` (latitude) and `Y` (longitude).\n    - **Key**: No primary key is mentioned, but typically, such a table would have an identifier that could be used to link records with other tables. In this case, it's implied that `SystemName` serves as a key or identifier.\n\n- **Table `wetland_ecologist_districts`**:\n    - **Columns**: This table contains data related to districts managed by ecologists, including `AGENCY` which likely represents the agency managing the district, and `TOWN` which denotes the town within the district.\n    - **Key**: No primary key is specified, but `AGENCY` might serve as a key or identifier for linking with other tables.\n\n- **Join condition** (`public_water_sources.SystemName = wetland_ecologist_districts.AGENCY`): This condition links the `SystemName` column from the `public_water_sources` table with the `AGENCY` column from the `wetland_ecologist_districts` table, allowing the retrieval of water source information that is associated with a specific ecological district.\n\n- **Where clause** (`wetland_ecologist_districts.TOWN = 'Your_Town_Name'`): This filters the results to only include those records where the `TOWN` field matches a predefined town name ('Your_Town_Name'). This ensures that the query returns only the geographic coordinates for water sources located within the specified town.\n\n### Business scenario:\nThis query is useful in environmental management or urban planning contexts. For instance, it could be used to analyze the distribution of water sources within a particular town, aiding in decisions related to water resource management, environmental conservation efforts, or urban development plans that require understanding the spatial distribution of natural resources.\n\n### User description:\nA user, possibly an environmental scientist, urban planner, or local government official, might need this information to understand the location of water sources in a specific town ('Your_Town_Name'). This could inform",
  "natural_language_query": "As an environmental professional or urban planner focused on the town named 'Your_Town_Name', I'm looking to gather detailed information on public water sources within our jurisdiction. Specifically, I need to know the precise geographical coordinates—latitude and longitude—of these water sources. To achieve this, I plan to cross-reference data from two databases: 'public_water_sources' and 'wetland_ecologist_districts'. The aim is to match the locations where the 'TOWN' field in the 'wetland_ecologist_districts' database exactly corresponds to 'Your_Town_Name', ensuring that all information retrieved pertains to water sources within our specific town boundaries.",
