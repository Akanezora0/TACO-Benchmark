  "problem_description": "### Query intent:\nThe SQL statement aims to retrieve specific attributes from two related tables (`outdoor_recreation_sites_inventory` and `lakepond_wbids_and_wbid_segments`) based on certain conditions.\n\n### Detailed description:\n\n1. **Tables Involved:**\n   - **`outdoor_recreation_sites_inventory`**: This table likely contains information about various outdoor recreation sites, such as their unique identifiers (`\"OBJECTID\"`), maps (`\"MAP\"`), names (`\"SITE_NAME\"`), public priorities (`\"PUBLIC_PRI\"`), boating management details (`\"BOATING_MA\"`), camping facilities (`\"CAMPING\"`), field sports availability (`\"FIELD_SPOR\"`), golf facilities (`\"GOLF\"`), and swimming amenities (`\"SWIMMING\"`).\n   - **`lakepond_wbids_and_wbid_segments`**: This table seems to link specific outdoor recreation sites with broader categories or segments (`\"EventType\"` and `\"Source\"`). Here, `\"EventType\"` could denote the type of recreation offered (like 'RECREATION'), and `\"Source\"` could indicate the origin or provider of the site information (like 'PARK').\n\n2. **Columns Selected:**\n   - The query selects several key attributes from `outdoor_recreation_sites_inventory`, including `OBJECTID`, `MAP`, `SITE_NAME`, `PUBLIC_PRI`, `BOATING_MA`, `CAMPING`, `FIELD_SPOR`, `GOLF`, and `SWIMMING`. These attributes provide details about the specific features and services available at each recreation site.\n\n3. **Conditions Used:**\n   - The `JOIN` clause connects `outdoor_recreation_sites_inventory` with `lakepond_wbids_and_wbid_segments` based on matching `OBJECTID`s. This ensures that the selected attributes from both tables are linked correctly.\n   - The `WHERE` clause filters the results by specifying that only rows where `lakepond_wbids_and_wbid_segments.\"EventType\"` is set to `'RECREATION'` and `lakepond_wbids_and_wbid_segments.\"Source\"` is `'PARK'` should be included. This condition narrows down the selection to parks that offer recreational activities.\n\n### Business Scenario:\nThis SQL query can be used in a park management system or tourism database to provide detailed information about recreational facilities within parks. For example, it might be used to generate a list of parks that offer both boating and camping facilities, sorted by public priority, for inclusion in promotional materials or for visitor guidance.",
  "natural_language_query": "I'm trying to find detailed information about outdoor recreation sites that are categorized under 'RECREATION' and sourced from 'PARK'. Specifically, I need data on sites that offer facilities like boating, camping, field sports, golf, and swimming. Can you help me pull this information together? It would be great if we could also include the unique identifier, map reference, and the name of each site, along with how high they're ranked in terms of public priority.",
