  "problem_description": "### Query intent:\nThe SQL statement aims to retrieve specific information from the `landfills` table based on a particular object ID.\n\n### Detailed description:\n- **Table**: `landfills`: This is the table from which data is being fetched. It likely contains various attributes related to landfills, such as their status and names.\n- **Columns**:\n    - `SITENAME`: The name of the landfill site.\n    - `STATUS`: The operational status of the landfill (e.g., active, inactive, closed).\n- **Condition**:\n    - `OBJECTID = '123'`: This condition filters the rows in the `landfills` table where the `OBJECTID` column has the value '123'. `OBJECTID` might represent a unique identifier for each record in the `landfills` table.\n\n### Business scenario:\nThis SQL query could be used in various business scenarios, such as:\n- **Environmental monitoring**: An environmental agency might use this query to quickly find the status and name of a specific landfill identified by its unique `OBJECTID`.\n- **Reporting and Compliance**: A regulatory body might need to check the status of a particular landfill as part of compliance checks or reporting requirements.\n\n### User description:\nA user might need to know the current status (e.g., open, closed) and the name of a specific landfill they are tracking due to environmental concerns, legal requirements, or operational oversight. For instance, an environmental scientist working for a government agency could use this query to ensure that all landfills within their jurisdiction are correctly classified and managed according to environmental regulations.",
