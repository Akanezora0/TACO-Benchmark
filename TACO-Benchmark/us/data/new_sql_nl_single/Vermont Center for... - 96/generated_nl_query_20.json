  "problem_description": "### Query intent:\nThe SQL statement aims to retrieve specific data from the `wetland_ecologist_districts` table based on certain conditions related to another table, `invasive_species`.\n\n### Detailed description:\n\n1. **Table**: `wetland_ecologist_districts`\n   - This table likely contains information about districts where ecologists work, possibly related to wetland management or conservation.\n\n2. **Columns**:\n   - `OBJECTID`: A unique identifier for each row in the table.\n   - `ABNAME`: The name of the district or some other descriptive attribute.\n\n3. **Condition**:\n   - `wetland_ecologist_districts.Town = (SELECT DISTINCT invasive_species.Town FROM invasive_species)`\n     - This condition ensures that only districts (`wetland_ecologist_districts`) are selected where the town name matches exactly one of the distinct town names found in the `invasive_species` table. This could mean finding districts with towns where invasive species have been reported.\n   - `wetland_ecologist_districts.ABNAME < 'Z'`\n     - This condition filters the rows so that only those with district names (`ABNAME`) alphabetically before 'Z' are included. This might be useful if districts with names starting with 'Z' are considered exceptional or not applicable in a certain context.\n\n### Business scenario:\nThis SQL query can be used in scenarios where there is a need to identify specific districts that match certain criteria across different datasets (e.g., invasive species reporting vs. wetland management).\n\n### User description:\nA user working in environmental conservation might need this information to prioritize areas for further investigation or intervention based on the presence of invasive species. For example, they might want to focus on districts that have seen an increase in invasive species populations, which are also known for their wetland ecosystems, potentially requiring more intensive management efforts.",
  "natural_language_query": "As an environmental conservation officer, I'm looking into the overlap between wetland management and invasive species reporting. I need to find out which districts, where ecologists work, have been specifically identified for managing wetlands and also have a history of invasive species being reported. Specifically, I'm interested in districts whose town names exactly match any of the distinct town names listed in the 'invasive_species' dataset. Additionally, I want to focus my analysis on districts whose names start alphabetically before 'Z'. This will help me prioritize areas that require immediate attention due to both wetland conservation needs and the potential impacts of invasive species.",
