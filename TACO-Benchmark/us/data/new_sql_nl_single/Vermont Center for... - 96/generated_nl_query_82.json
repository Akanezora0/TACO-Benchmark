  "problem_description": "### Query intent:\nThe SQL statement is designed to retrieve specific information from two related tables, `outdoor_recreation_sites_inventory` and `waste_water_facilities`. The goal is to find the name of outdoor recreation sites that have corresponding facilities for waste water management.\n\n### Detailed description:\n- **Tables**: `outdoor_recreation_sites_inventory` and `waste_water_facilities`.\n  - `outdoor_recreation_sites_inventory`: This table likely contains data about various outdoor recreation sites, including an identifier called `OBJECTID`.\n  - `waste_water_facilities`: This table likely contains data about waste water management facilities, with a column named `FacilityID`.\n\n- **Columns**:\n  - From `outdoor_recreation_sites_inventory`: `NAME`, which presumably holds the names of the outdoor recreation sites.\n  - From `waste_water_facilities`: `FacilityName`, which likely represents the names of the waste water management facilities.\n\n- **Conditions**:\n  - `outdoor_recreation_sites_inventory.OBJECTID = waste_water_facilities.FacilityID`: This condition ensures that the query only returns records where there is a matching `OBJECTID` (indicating an outdoor recreation site) and `FacilityID` (indicating a corresponding waste water facility).\n\n### Business scenario:\nThis query can be utilized in environmental management or urban planning contexts where it's necessary to link outdoor recreation areas with their associated waste water management facilities. For instance, it might help in assessing the impact of recreational activities on local water quality, planning for infrastructure improvements, or ensuring compliance with environmental regulations.\n\n### User description:\nUsers might need this information to:\n- **Assess environmental impact**: Understand how outdoor activities at certain sites might affect nearby waste water facilities and vice versa.\n- **Plan infrastructure**: Determine if there is a need to upgrade or add waste water management facilities near popular recreation sites.\n- **Regulatory compliance**: Ensure that all outdoor recreation sites are properly linked with adequate waste water treatment facilities, meeting environmental standards.\n- **Resource allocation**: Allocate resources effectively for maintenance, upgrades, or new installations based on the proximity and relationship between recreation sites and waste water facilities.",
  "natural_language_query": "User: I'm trying to understand how outdoor recreation sites are connected to waste water management facilities in our city. Specifically, I want to know the names of outdoor sites that have corresponding waste water facilities. Can you help me with this?\n\nAssistant: Assistant: Sure, I can assist you with that. To get the names of outdoor recreation sites that are linked with waste water facilities, we'll look into two tables: \"outdoor_recreation_sites_inventory\" and \"waste_water_facilities\". \n\nFrom the \"outdoor_recreation_sites_inventory\" table, we're interested in the 'NAME' column, which should list the names of the outdoor sites. On the other hand, the 'FacilityName' column in the \"waste_water_facilities\" table will provide us with the names of the waste water management facilities.\n\nTo ensure that we're looking at pairs where each outdoor site has a corresponding waste water facility, we'll use a condition that matches the 'OBJECTID' from the 'outdoor_recreation_sites_inventory' table with the 'FacilityID' from the 'waste_water_facilities' table. This way, we can identify which outdoor sites are connected to specific waste water facilities.\n\nThis information could be crucial for various purposes such as assessing environmental impacts, planning infrastructure, ensuring regulatory compliance, or efficiently allocating resources for maintenance and upgrades. Let's proceed with the query to fetch these details.",
