  "problem_description": "### Query intent:\nThe SQL statement aims to retrieve specific information from a table named `outdoor_recreation_sites_inventory`.\n\n### Detailed description:\n- **Table**: `outdoor_recreation_sites_inventory` - This table is likely associated with managing data about outdoor recreation sites, possibly including details such as inventory, locations, or resources available at these sites.\n- **Columns**:\n  - `X`: This column's nature is not specified but could represent a coordinate (latitude or longitude) or another identifier related to the site's location.\n  - `Y`: Similarly, this column might also represent a coordinate (latitude or longitude), or it could be another identifier or attribute relevant to the site.\n  - `OBJECTID`: A unique identifier for each record in the table, which here is used as a condition for filtering.\n\n- **Condition**:\n  - `outdoor_recreation_sites_inventory.OBJECTID = 1` - The query filters records where the `OBJECTID` is exactly 1, essentially selecting information about the site uniquely identified by `OBJECTID` 1.\n\n### Business scenario:\nThis SQL query can be used in various business scenarios, particularly in outdoor recreation management systems:\n\n- **Scenario 1: Site Management**: System administrators or managers might use this query to inspect detailed information about a specific site (identified by `OBJECTID` 1) to make decisions on resource allocation, maintenance schedules, or site improvements.\n- **Scenario 2: Visitor Information**: For visitors, this information might be part of a larger system that provides details about the site's location, available facilities, or activities, helping them plan their visit effectively.\n\n### User description:\nA user, perhaps an administrator tasked with overseeing multiple outdoor recreation sites, encounters a need to quickly access detailed information about one particular site for planning purposes. Using this SQL query, they can efficiently retrieve the coordinates (`X`, `Y`) and the unique identifier (`OBJECTID`) of the site they are interested in, facilitating further analysis or updates to the site's status within the management system.",
  "natural_language_query": "User Description:\nAs a manager responsible for several outdoor recreational areas, I'm looking to gather detailed information about a specific site for a project. I've been assigned to review the inventory and location data of one of our sites. To ensure accuracy and efficiency, I want to retrieve the exact coordinates and a unique identifier for this site. Unfortunately, I don't have the specific name or ID of the site, but I know there's a method to do this through our database system. How can I run a query to get this information without knowing the exact table or column names?\n\nNatural Language Query:\nI'm managing a portfolio of outdoor recreation spots and need to fetch detailed info on a particular site for a project. My task involves pulling up the location specifics like coordinates and a unique marker for this site, but I don't have the site's name or ID handy. Our database system allows for queries to extract such details. Could you guide me on how to run a command to obtain these pieces of information?",
