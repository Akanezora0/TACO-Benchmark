  "problem_description": "### Query intent:\nThe SQL statement aims to retrieve specific details from two tables, `salt_storage_record_table` and `landfills`, by joining them based on a common identifier (`OBJECTID`) and filtering the results based on the material type.\n\n### Detailed description:\n1. **Table `salt_storage_record_table`**:\n   - This table likely contains records related to the storage of materials, possibly including addresses (`address_full`), material types, and identifiers (`OBJECTID`).\n   - The column `material_type` is used to filter the records, specifically looking for entries where the material type is 'Salt'.\n\n2. **Table `landfills`**:\n   - This table seems to contain geographical data, potentially including latitude (`LATITUDE`) and longitude (`LONGITUDE`) coordinates for locations.\n   - It also includes an `OBJECTID` column, which is used as a join condition with the `salt_storage_record_table`.\n\n3. **Join operation**:\n   - The SQL statement performs an inner join between `salt_storage_record_table` and `landfills` using the `OBJECTID` column. This means it will only return rows where there is a match in both tables based on this identifier.\n\n4. **Where clause**:\n   - The `WHERE` clause filters the joined result set to include only those rows from `salt_storage_record_table` where the `material_type` is 'Salt'. This ensures that only records containing salt are returned along with their associated geographical coordinates.\n\n### Business scenario:\nThis query is typically used in logistics, environmental monitoring, or urban planning contexts where one needs to locate and manage the storage of specific materials, such as salt, which might be used for de-icing roads or other purposes. The ability to quickly find the geographical locations (latitude and longitude) of salt storage facilities based on their type allows for efficient management and response planning.\n\n### User description:\nA user, possibly a logistics manager or environmental regulator, might need to locate all the places where salt is stored within a certain area or city. They would use this query to retrieve the precise addresses of these storage sites along with their geographical coordinates, enabling them to plan routes, monitor inventory, or respond to emergencies more effectively.",
  "natural_language_query": "A logistics manager is seeking a comprehensive list of locations where salt is stored within their company's facilities. Specifically, they need to know the exact addresses of these sites along with their geographical coordinates, to facilitate efficient inventory management and emergency response planning. To achieve this, they are running a SQL query that joins two databases: 'salt_storage_record_table' and 'landfills'. The 'salt_storage_record_table' contains information about the storage activities, including the full address of each location, the type of material stored (in this case, 'Salt'), and a unique identifier ('OBJECTID'). The 'landfills' database holds geographical data, featuring latitude and longitude coordinates ('LATITUDE' and 'LONGITUDE') for each site. By performing an INNER JOIN on the 'OBJECTID' column, the query merges these two datasets. The WHERE clause filters the results to include only those rows from the 'salt_storage_record_table' where the material type is identified as 'Salt', ensuring that the output provides detailed information about the storage locations of salt exclusively.",
