  "problem_description": "### Query intent:\nThe SQL statement is designed to retrieve specific data from two tables (`dfirm_floodways` and `vermont_biophysical_regions`) based on certain conditions.\n\n### Detailed description:\n\n1. **Tables Involved:**\n   - **`dfirm_floodways`** : This table contains information related to floodways (areas prone to flooding) within the firm's jurisdiction. It includes various attributes such as `OBJECTID`, `DFIRM_ID`, `FLD_AR_ID`, `FLD_ZONE`, `FLOODWAY`, `SFHA_TF`, `AR_REVERT`, `SOURCE_CIT`, `HYDRO_ID`, `CST_MDL_ID`.\n   - **`vermont_biophysical_regions`** : This table likely contains information about biophysical regions within Vermont, including `OBJECTID`, `ACRES`, `NAME`, `SUBSEC_ID`, `BPR_NUM`, `BPR_NUMID`.\n\n2. **Columns Selected:**\n   - The query selects specific columns from both tables, which are `OBJECTID`, `DFIRM_ID`, `FLD_AR_ID`, `FLD_ZONE`, `FLOODWAY`, `SFHA_TF`, `AR_REVERT`, `SOURCE_CIT`, `HYDRO_ID`, `CST_MDL_ID` from `dfirm_floodways` and `OBJECTID`, `ACRES`, `NAME`, `SUBSEC_ID`, `BPR_NUM`, `BPR_NUMID` from `vermont_biophysical_regions`.\n\n3. **Conditions:**\n   - The query filters data where the `FLD_ZONE` column in `dfirm_floodways` equals `'specific_zone'`. This suggests the user is interested in floodway data for a particular zone.\n   - It also requires matching rows in `vermont_biophysical_regions` where the `NAME` column equals `'specific_region'`. This indicates the user wants to correlate floodway data with specific biophysical regions in Vermont.\n\n### Business scenario:\nThis query is typically used in environmental management, urban planning, or disaster risk assessment contexts. It helps to identify and analyze floodway characteristics within specific zones of interest, particularly within predefined biophysical regions in Vermont. For example, an urban planner might use this query to understand the potential impact of flooding in a specific area (e.g., 'specific_zone') by correlating it with the land use and biophysical characteristics of the region ('specific_region').\n\n### User description:\nA user, possibly an environmental scientist or a",
  "natural_language_query": "An environmental scientist working on a project focusing on flood risk management in specific areas of Vermont is seeking detailed information. They are particularly interested in understanding the characteristics of floodways within a designated flood zone ('specific_zone') and how these floodways intersect with the biophysical regions of Vermont. Their goal is to assess the potential environmental impacts and develop strategies for mitigation.\n\nTo achieve this, they have crafted a SQL query that aims to extract specific data from two databases: 'dfirm_floodways' and 'vermont_biophysical_regions'. From 'dfirm_floodways', they wish to retrieve the 'OBJECTID', 'DFIRM_ID', 'FLD_AR_ID', 'FLD_ZONE', 'FLOODWAY', 'SFHA_TF', 'AR_REVERT', 'SOURCE_CIT', 'HYDRO_ID', and 'CST_MDL_ID'. These attributes provide insights into the floodway locations, zoning details, and other critical characteristics.\n\nSimilarly, from 'vermont_biophysical_regions', they are interested in obtaining the 'OBJECTID', 'ACRES', 'NAME', 'SUBSEC_ID', 'BPR_NUM', and 'BPR_NUMID'. These columns offer information about the geographic area sizes, names of the regions, sub-section identifiers, and biophysical region numbers, which are crucial for understanding the ecological context.\n\nThe query employs conditions to ensure the data retrieved is relevant to their study. Specifically, it filters 'dfirm_floodways' to include only those entries where the 'FLD_ZONE' field matches 'specific_zone'. This ensures that the floodway data corresponds to the zone of interest. Additionally, it requires matching records in 'vermont_biophysical_regions' where the 'NAME' field exactly equals 'specific_region'. This step guarantees that the biophysical region information aligns with the geographic focus of their research.\n\nIn essence, this SQL query serves as a powerful tool for the environmental scientist to correlate floodway characteristics with specific biophysical regions in Vermont, providing a comprehensive dataset for further analysis and decision-making in flood risk management.",
