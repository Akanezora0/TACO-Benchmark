  "problem_description": "### Query intent:\nThe SQL statement aims to retrieve specific information from two related tables: `outdoor_recreation_sites_inventory` and `vermont_biophysical_regions`. The goal is to find records where the site name contains the word 'park' and the biophysical region name contains the word 'forest'. This suggests a query for identifying parks located within forested areas.\n\n### Detailed description:\n1. **Table and Column Involved**:\n   - **`outdoor_recreation_sites_inventory`**: This table likely contains information about various outdoor recreation sites, possibly including details like location, type, accessibility, and so on. A key column here is `\"SITE_NAME\"`, which identifies each site by name.\n   - **`vermont_biophysical_regions`**: This table probably contains information about different biophysical regions within Vermont, a state in the United States. A critical column in this table is `NAME`, providing names for these regions.\n\n2. **Join Operation**:\n   - The `JOIN` clause links these two tables based on a common identifier, `OBJECTID`. This implies that each outdoor recreation site has a corresponding entry in the `vermont_biophysical_regions` table that specifies its location within one of Vermont's biophysical regions.\n\n3. **Where Clause Conditions**:\n   - **`outdoor_recreation_sites_inventory.\"SITE_NAME\" LIKE '%park%'****: This condition filters out all records where the site name includes the word 'park', which could refer to parks, reserves, or similar areas suitable for outdoor recreation.\n   - **`vermont_biophysical_regions.NAME LIKE '%forest%'****: Similarly, this condition ensures that only records associated with forested areas are included in the result set.\n\n### Business Scenario:\nThis query is useful for environmental planners, conservationists, or tourism officials who are interested in understanding the distribution of parks within forested regions. It helps identify potential areas for enhancing recreational facilities, assessing biodiversity, or planning educational tours that focus on natural landscapes.\n\n### User Description:\nA user might need this information when planning new recreational activities, conducting environmental impact assessments, or developing marketing materials that highlight natural attractions in Vermont. For instance, a tourism board might use this data to create brochures or online guides that feature parks nestled within forested areas, appealing to nature enthusiasts and families looking for outdoor adventure.",
  "natural_language_query": "I'm trying to gather information about outdoor recreation sites in Vermont that are located within forested areas. Specifically, I'm interested in finding sites named 'park' and ensuring they are situated in biophysical regions marked as 'forest'. This will help me understand the distribution of parks in forested parts of Vermont, which could be useful for planning new recreational activities or creating engaging content for tourists interested in nature. Could you assist me with a SQL query that would fetch such details?",
