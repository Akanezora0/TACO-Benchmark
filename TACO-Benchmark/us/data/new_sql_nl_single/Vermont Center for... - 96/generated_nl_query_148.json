  "problem_description": "### Query intent:\nThe SQL statement is designed to retrieve specific data points related to active water sources and their high-effectiveness treatments for invasive species.\n\n### Detailed description:\n1. **Tables involved**:\n   - `public_water_sources`: This table likely contains information about various public water sources, including an identifier `WSID` for each source.\n   - `invasive_species`: This table holds details about invasive species, including an `ObservationID` that might correspond to the identifier of a specific observation or event.\n\n2. **Columns involved**:\n   - From `public_water_sources`, we are selecting `X` and `Y`, which could represent coordinates (latitude and longitude) or possibly identifiers for the water sources.\n   - From `invasive_species`, we are selecting `X` and `Y`, which similarly could represent coordinates or identifiers related to observations of invasive species.\n\n3. **Conditions specified**:\n   - **Inner Join**: This operation combines rows from both tables where there is a match on `WSID` in `public_water_sources` and `ObservationID` in `invasive_species`. It ensures that only those water sources with corresponding invasive species observations are included in the result set.\n   - **WHERE clause**:\n     - `public_water_sources.SystemStatus = 'Active'`: This condition filters out any inactive water sources, ensuring that only currently operational sources are considered.\n     - `invasive_species.TreatmentEffectiveness = 'High'`: This condition filters invasive species observations based on the effectiveness of treatments applied, specifically looking for cases where treatments have been highly effective.\n\n### Business scenario:\nThis query is useful in environmental management and conservation efforts, particularly in aquatic ecosystems. It helps in identifying active water sources that have experienced high-effectiveness treatments against invasive species. This information can be crucial for:\n- **Monitoring and Assessment**: To track the progress of invasive species control efforts across different water bodies.\n- **Strategic Planning**: To prioritize resources and interventions at locations where treatments have been successful, potentially indicating more effective strategies or outcomes.\n- **Policy Making**: To inform policies regarding water management, treatment efficacy, and resource allocation for environmental protection.\n\n### User description:\nA user, possibly an environmental scientist or a policy maker, might need this information to evaluate the success of recent invasive species management projects, plan future interventions, or allocate resources more effectively based on past treatment outcomes. The ability to pinpoint active water sources with high-effectiveness treatments allows for targeted follow-up studies or maintenance actions to ensure continued effectiveness or to replicate successful",
  "natural_language_query": "As an environmental consultant, I am interested in identifying active water sources in our region where high-effectiveness treatments have been successfully applied to manage invasive species. Specifically, I would like to analyze data from two databases: one containing information about all public water sources within our jurisdiction, and another holding records of invasive species observations and the treatments applied.\n\nTo achieve this, I need to run a SQL query that combines these databases under certain conditions:\n\n1. **Data Sources**:\n   - **Public Water Sources Database**: This database includes details about every water source, such as its unique identifier (`WSID`), which helps us pinpoint specific locations.\n   - **Invasive Species Observations Database**: Here, we have records of invasive species (`ObservationID`) and the treatments (`TreatmentEffectiveness`) that were deemed effective.\n\n2. **Selected Data**:\n   - From the `Public Water Sources` table, I want to select the identifiers (`WSID`) and possibly coordinates (`X` and `Y`) for each water source, to geographically locate them.\n   - From the `Invasive Species Observations` table, I aim to retrieve similar identifiers (`ObservationID`) and coordinates (`X` and `Y`), aligning them with specific events or instances of invasive species presence.\n\n3. **Query Conditions**:\n   - **Join Operation**: I will use an INNER JOIN to combine these tables based on matching identifiers (`WSID` and `ObservationID`), ensuring that only those water sources with direct correlations to invasive species observations are included in the final dataset.\n   - **Filtering Criteria**:\n     - **Active Water Sources**: I am only interested in water sources that are currently operational (`SystemStatus = 'Active'`), excluding any that are no longer functioning or under maintenance.\n     - **Highly Effective Treatments**: I focus on treatments (`TreatmentEffectiveness = 'High'`) that have shown significant success in managing invasive species, indicating potential best practices for future interventions.\n\nThis analysis will provide insights into the most effective strategies for controlling invasive species across our region's active water sources, guiding future environmental management decisions and investment in conservation efforts.",
