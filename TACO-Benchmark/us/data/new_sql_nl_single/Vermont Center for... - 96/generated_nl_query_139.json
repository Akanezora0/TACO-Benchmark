  "problem_description": "### Query intent:\nThe SQL statement is designed to retrieve specific data from two related tables: `sand_and_gravel_deposits` and `dfirm_floodways`. The primary goal is to find records where the type of activity (`AG_TYPE`) in `sand_and_gravel_deposits` is set to 'strict', and then match these records with corresponding floodway data in `dfirm_floodways`.\n\n### Detailed description:\n- **Table `sand_and_gravel_deposits`**:\n    - **Columns**:\n        - `OBJECTID`: A unique identifier for each record in this table.\n        - `AG_TYPE`: Indicates the type of activity or operation performed (in this case, 'strict').\n    - **Role**: This table contains detailed information about sand and gravel deposits, including their types.\n\n- **Table `dfirm_floodways`**:\n    - **Columns**:\n        - `FLOODWAY`: Identifies the specific floodway being referenced.\n        - `FLD_AR_ID`: An identifier that links records in this table back to the appropriate deposit record in `sand_and_gravel_deposits`.\n    - **Role**: This table provides information about floodways, particularly which ones might intersect or be affected by sand and gravel operations.\n\n- **Join condition** (`sand_and_gravel_deposits.GlobalID = dfirm_floodways.FLD_AR_ID`): This condition ensures that only those sand and gravel deposit records that have a matching floodway ID in `dfirm_floodways` are selected.\n\n- **Where clause** (`sand_and_gravel_deposits.AG_TYPE = 'strict'`): This filters the results to include only those records where the activity type is specifically labeled as 'strict'.\n\n### Business scenario:\nThis query is useful in environmental management or urban planning contexts where the impact of sand and gravel extraction on local floodways needs to be assessed. For instance, it could help in identifying areas where strict regulations apply due to potential environmental concerns related to flood control.\n\n### User description:\nA user in an environmental regulatory agency or a construction planning department might need to quickly identify which sand and gravel extraction sites are subject to stringent regulations and how they relate to existing flood management infrastructure. This information is crucial for compliance checks, environmental impact assessments, or planning new construction projects that must avoid or mitigate risks associated with flood zones.",
  "natural_language_query": "An environmental agency is tasked with monitoring and regulating activities around floodways to ensure compliance with safety standards. They are particularly interested in verifying if any sand and gravel extraction sites within their jurisdiction are subject to stricter regulations ('strict' AG_TYPE) and if these sites intersect with any designated floodways. To achieve this, they plan to run a database query using SQL to retrieve relevant information.\n\nTo execute this task, they will:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Tables**: They will look into two main tables within their database - `sand_and_gravel_deposits` and `dfirm_floodways`.\n\n   - **Table `sand_and_gravel_deposits`**:\n     - **Columns**: `OBJECTID`, `AG_TYPE`\n     - **Description**: This table contains records detailing sand and gravel extraction sites, with a specific column indicating the type of activity conducted at each site, including whether it's 'strict'.\n\n   - **Table `dfirm_floodways`**:\n     - **Columns**: `FLOODWAY`, `FLD_AR_ID`\n     - **Description**: This table lists floodways and includes an identifier that can link to specific sand and gravel extraction sites, allowing the agency to understand the spatial relationship between these sites and flood management areas.\n\n2. **Define Join Condition**: They will use a join condition to match records between these two tables based on the `FLD_AR_ID` in `dfirm_floodways` and the `OBJECTID` in `sand_and_gravel_deposits`. This ensures that only sites with a direct connection to floodways are considered in the analysis.\n\n3. **Set Filtering Criteria**: The query will include a WHERE clause to filter out only those records where the `AG_TYPE` in `sand_and_gravel_deposits` is set to 'strict'. This narrows down the focus to sites under heightened scrutiny due to potential environmental impacts.\n\n4. **Query Execution**: By running this SQL query, the agency aims to efficiently gather data on sand and gravel extraction sites that require special attention due to their regulatory status and proximity to floodways. This information is critical for ongoing monitoring, compliance enforcement, and future planning to minimize risks associated with both extraction activities and flood management.\n\nIn summary, the natural language query would be structured as follows:\n\n\"An environmental agency wishes to analyze and identify any sand and gravel extraction sites that are subject to stricter regulations ('strict' AG_TYPE) and are located near any floodways. To accomplish this, they plan to utilize a SQL query that combines",
