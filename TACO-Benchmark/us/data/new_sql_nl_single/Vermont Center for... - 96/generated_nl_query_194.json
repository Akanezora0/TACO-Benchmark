  "problem_description": "### Query intent:\nThe SQL statement aims to retrieve specific pieces of data from two related tables: `salt_storage_record_table` and `salt_landslides`. The intent is to find details about the storage locations (`address_full`) associated with materials of type 'Clay', specifically focusing on those records where the landslide type is identified as 'Slide'.\n\n### Detailed description:\n- **Table `salt_storage_record_table`**:\n    - **Columns**: This table likely contains records about storage facilities for various materials. The column `OBJECTID` is presumably a unique identifier for each record in this table.\n    - **Column `material_type`**: This column specifies the type of material stored at the given location.\n\n- **Table `salt_landslides`**:\n    - **Columns**: This table likely contains records about landslides, possibly including an `OBJECTID` to link it back to specific storage records.\n    - **Column `LS_TYPE1`**: This column identifies the type of landslide, which is being filtered to only include 'Slide' type landslides.\n\n- **Join condition** (`salt_storage_record_table.OBJECTID = salt_landslides.OBJECTID`): This condition ensures that the rows selected from both tables are directly linked by their `OBJECTID`, allowing the retrieval of corresponding data between the two tables based on this unique identifier.\n\n- **WHERE clause**:\n    - **`salt_storage_record_table.material_type = 'Clay'`**: Filters the results to only include records where the material type is 'Clay'.\n    - **`salt_landslides.LS_TYPE1 = 'Slide'`**: Further filters the results to include only those records where there has been a landslide of type 'Slide'.\n\n### Business scenario:\nThis SQL query might be used in a context where a company or organization needs to assess the risk associated with storing materials like clay near potential landslide areas. By identifying storage locations (`address_full`) where clay is stored (`material_type = 'Clay'`) and where there have been slides (`LS_TYPE1 = 'Slide'`), the query helps in prioritizing safety measures or risk mitigation strategies for these specific sites.\n\n### User description:\nA user, perhaps a facility manager or an environmental compliance officer, might need to identify any clay storage areas that are potentially at high risk due to historical or forecasted landslide activity. This information is crucial for planning emergency responses, maintenance schedules, or even deciding on relocating sensitive materials to safer locations.",
  "natural_language_query": "As a facility manager tasked with ensuring the safety and compliance of our storage operations, I'm looking into the database to gather information on any locations where we store clay materials. Specifically, I'm interested in identifying if there have been any instances where landslides of the 'Slide' type have occurred near these storage areas. \n\nTo achieve this, I need to run a query that will sift through our records. On one side, I want to look at our 'salt_storage_record_table', which tracks all our storage locations and the types of materials stored there. I'm particularly interested in records where the material type is 'Clay'. \n\nOn the other side, I'll be examining our 'salt_landslides' table, which documents any landslide incidents. My focus here is to filter out any records where the landslide type is identified as 'Slide'. \n\nI'm hoping to connect these two tables using their common identifier, 'OBJECTID', so that I can cross-reference storage locations with landslide occurrences. My query should then highlight any clay storage areas ('material_type = 'Clay'') that have been affected by slides ('LS_TYPE1 = 'Slide''). This information will be invaluable in assessing risks and planning necessary safety measures for our operations.",
