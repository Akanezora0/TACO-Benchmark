  "problem_description": "### Query intent:\nThe SQL statement aims to select specific attributes (X, Y) from a table named `public_water_sources` where the system status is marked as 'Operational'. This operation is designed to filter out all records that do not meet the operational status criteria.\n\n### Detailed description:\n1. **Table**: The query operates on the `public_water_sources` table. This table likely contains various records related to water sources, possibly including their geographical coordinates (X, Y), status, and other relevant information.\n2. **Columns**: The columns selected are `X` and `Y`. These could represent longitude and latitude, respectively, which would be useful for mapping water source locations.\n3. **Condition**: The condition `public_water_sources.SystemStatus = 'Operational'` filters the records to include only those where the system status is marked as 'Operational'. This implies that the water source is currently functional and available for use.\n4. **Joins and Subqueries**: There are no joins or subqueries mentioned in this statement, suggesting a straightforward selection based on a single condition.\n\n### Business scenario:\nThis SQL query is typically used in scenarios where maintenance personnel, environmental analysts, or urban planners need to quickly identify active water sources. For example:\n\n- **Maintenance**: Maintenance teams might use this query to locate all active water sources that require inspection or maintenance.\n- **Environmental Monitoring**: Environmental agencies could employ this query to monitor the operational status of water sources across a region, helping to ensure water supply reliability and environmental compliance.\n- **Urban Planning**: Urban planners might utilize this query to understand the spatial distribution of operational water sources for planning new infrastructure, such as pipelines or water treatment plants.\n\n### User description:\nA user might face a situation where they need to efficiently manage resources or plan operations related to water sources. For instance, a city manager might need to quickly identify which water pumps are operational to prioritize maintenance tasks or to ensure there are enough resources to handle increased demand during peak times. Similarly, an environmental scientist might require this information to assess the health of aquatic ecosystems dependent on these water sources.",
  "natural_language_query": "As a city manager tasked with maintaining our water infrastructure, I often need to quickly pinpoint which of our water sources are currently operational. Given the vast number of water sources across our city, it's crucial to have an efficient method to filter through the data and focus on areas that require immediate attention. \n\nSpecifically, I'm looking for a way to run a database query that selects the geographical coordinates (latitude and longitude) of all water sources that are marked as 'Operational'. This will help me to map out our active water sources, ensuring that any necessary maintenance or checks can be prioritized effectively. By identifying which systems are functioning properly, we can allocate resources more efficiently and respond promptly to any potential issues that may arise, thereby maintaining a reliable water supply for our residents.",
