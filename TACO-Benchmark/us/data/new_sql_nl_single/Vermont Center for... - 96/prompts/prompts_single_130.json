    "problem_description": "### Query intent:\nThe SQL statement aims to retrieve specific geographic coordinates (X, Y) from two related tables, `outdoor_recreation_sites_inventory` and `landslide`, where the X and Y coordinates match between these two tables. Additionally, it seeks to find a particular record in `outdoor_recreation_sites_inventory` identified by `OBJECTID = 1`.\n\n### Detailed description:\n- **Tables involved**: `landslide` and `outdoor_recreation_sites_inventory`.\n- **Columns selected**: From `outdoor_recreation_sites_inventory`, the query selects `X` and `Y` which are likely representing longitude and latitude coordinates, respectively. From `landslide`, it selects `OBJECTID`, possibly an identifier for each record.\n- **Join condition**: The query joins these two tables based on matching values of `X` and `Y` columns, indicating that the records should represent the same geographic location.\n- **Where clause**: It filters the results further by specifying that only the records from `outdoor_recreation_sites_inventory` with `OBJECTID = 1` should be included.\n\n### Business scenario:\nThis query is useful in scenarios where there is a need to correlate specific locations or geographic points between two datasets, particularly when one dataset contains detailed information about recreational sites (like `outdoor_recreation_sites_inventory`) and another contains data related to natural hazards such as landslides (`landslide`). For example:\n\n- **Environmental Impact Assessment**: Identifying areas with both high-risk landslide zones and potential recreational sites to assess safety measures needed for visitors or residents.\n- **Urban Planning**: Planning new recreational facilities near known landslide-prone areas but ensuring the facilities are safe, possibly by excluding those sites that have had recent or severe landslide activity.\n\n### User description:\nUsers might encounter situations where they need to ensure that recreational activities are not set up in areas prone to landslides, especially in disaster management contexts or urban planning projects. By running this query, they can efficiently identify overlapping geographic points between their list of planned recreational sites and existing landslide data, facilitating informed decision-making regarding site selection and safety protocols.",
