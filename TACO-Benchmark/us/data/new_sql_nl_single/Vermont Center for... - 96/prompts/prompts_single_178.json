    "problem_description": "### Query intent:\nThe SQL statement aims to retrieve specific data from a table named `landslide`. The primary goal is to select the `OBJECTID` and `FIELD_VISIT` columns for rows where `STYLE_FAIL` equals 'type' and `LS_TYPE1` equals 'subtype'. The results are sorted in descending order based on `FIELD_VISIT`.\n\n### Detailed description:\n- **Table**: `landslide` - This table is likely part of a larger database system that contains detailed records about landslides, possibly including their identification (`OBJECTID`), various characteristics or failure styles (`STYLE_FAIL`), types (`LS_TYPE1`), and possibly other relevant fields like `FIELD_VISIT`.\n- **Columns**:\n    - `OBJECTID`: A unique identifier for each landslide record.\n    - `FIELD_VISIT`: A field that could represent a visit or inspection record related to the landslide, potentially containing details such as date, personnel, or findings.\n    - `STYLE_FAIL` and `LS_TYPE1`: These columns seem to describe the style of failure and type of the landslide, respectively. 'type' and 'subtype' suggest specific categories within these descriptions.\n- **Conditions**:\n    - `landslide.STYLE_FAIL = 'type'`: Filters the records to only include those where the style of failure is specifically identified as 'type'.\n    - `landslide.LS_TYPE1 = 'subtype'`: Further narrows down the selection to include only those records where the landslide type is specifically identified as 'subtype'.\n- **Sorting**:\n    - `ORDER BY landslide.FIELD_VISIT DESC`: Sorts the resulting records in descending order by the `FIELD_VISIT` column, meaning the most recent visits or inspections come first.\n\n### Business scenario:\nThis SQL query might be used in a scenario where a geosciences or environmental management team is analyzing specific landslide events that have been categorized into certain failure styles and types. The team might be interested in reviewing the most recent field visits or inspections conducted for these specific landslide types to assess the current status, gather new data, or plan follow-up actions.\n\n### User description:\nA user working in a geological survey or environmental monitoring department might need this information to efficiently manage resources for monitoring and assessing risks associated with particular types of landslides. By focusing on recent field visits for specific failure styles and types, the user can prioritize areas that require immediate attention or further investigation. This could help in updating risk assessments, planning maintenance activities, or initiating corrective measures to prevent potential hazards.",
