    "problem_description": "### Query intent:\nThe SQL statement aims to retrieve specific attributes from two related tables (`outdoor_recreation_sites_inventory` and `lakepond_wbids_and_wbid_segments`) based on certain conditions.\n\n### Detailed description:\n\n1. **Tables Involved:**\n   - **`outdoor_recreation_sites_inventory`**: This table likely contains information about various outdoor recreation sites, such as their unique identifiers (`\"OBJECTID\"`), maps (`\"MAP\"`), names (`\"SITE_NAME\"`), public priorities (`\"PUBLIC_PRI\"`), boating management details (`\"BOATING_MA\"`), camping facilities (`\"CAMPING\"`), field sports availability (`\"FIELD_SPOR\"`), golf facilities (`\"GOLF\"`), and swimming amenities (`\"SWIMMING\"`).\n   - **`lakepond_wbids_and_wbid_segments`**: This table seems to link specific outdoor recreation sites with broader categories or segments (`\"EventType\"` and `\"Source\"`). Here, `\"EventType\"` could denote the type of recreation offered (like 'RECREATION'), and `\"Source\"` could indicate the origin or provider of the site information (like 'PARK').\n\n2. **Columns Selected:**\n   - The query selects several key attributes from `outdoor_recreation_sites_inventory`, including `OBJECTID`, `MAP`, `SITE_NAME`, `PUBLIC_PRI`, `BOATING_MA`, `CAMPING`, `FIELD_SPOR`, `GOLF`, and `SWIMMING`. These attributes provide details about the specific features and services available at each recreation site.\n\n3. **Conditions Used:**\n   - The `JOIN` clause connects `outdoor_recreation_sites_inventory` with `lakepond_wbids_and_wbid_segments` based on matching `OBJECTID`s. This ensures that the selected attributes from both tables are linked correctly.\n   - The `WHERE` clause filters the results by specifying that only rows where `lakepond_wbids_and_wbid_segments.\"EventType\"` is set to `'RECREATION'` and `lakepond_wbids_and_wbid_segments.\"Source\"` is `'PARK'` should be included. This condition narrows down the selection to parks that offer recreational activities.\n\n### Business Scenario:\nThis SQL query can be used in a park management system or tourism database to provide detailed information about recreational facilities within parks. For example, it might be used to generate a list of parks that offer both boating and camping facilities, sorted by public priority, for inclusion in promotional materials or for visitor guidance.",
