This means the query is focused on systems that are currently operational.\n\n### Business scenario:\nIn the context of water management and infrastructure monitoring, this SQL query can be used to identify which water sources are currently operational. This is crucial for several reasons:\n\n- **Resource Allocation**: Knowing which water sources are operational helps in efficiently allocating resources like maintenance personnel, equipment, and materials to these systems.\n  \n- **Emergency Preparedness**: If an operational system fails, it's important to quickly identify the affected source to plan for alternative water supply or immediate repairs.\n  \n- **Performance Monitoring**: Tracking operational statuses over time can provide insights into the reliability and performance of different water sources, aiding in strategic planning and decision-making.\n\n### User description:\nA water management official might need this information to ensure that all operational water sources are functioning properly and to prepare for potential disruptions. For instance, during peak demand periods, understanding which sources are operational helps in maintaining a stable water supply to communities. Additionally, the official might use this data to prioritize maintenance tasks or to initiate repairs at non-operational sources before they become critical.",
