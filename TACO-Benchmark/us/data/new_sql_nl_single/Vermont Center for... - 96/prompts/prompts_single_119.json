    "problem_description": "### Query intent:\nThe SQL statement is designed to retrieve specific details from two tables related to outdoor recreation sites and wildlife management units, with a focus on a particular site and agency.\n\n### Detailed description:\n- **Tables involved**:\n  - `outdoor_recreation_sites_inventory`: This table likely contains information about various outdoor recreational sites, including details like object identifiers (`\"OBJECTID\"`), mapping data (`\"MAP\"`), site names (`\"SITE_NAME\"`), public priority (`\"PUBLIC_PRI\"`), boating management (`\"BOATING_MA\"`), camping facilities (`\"CAMPING\"`), field sports (`\"FIELD_SPOR\"`), golf facilities (`\"GOLF\"`), and swimming areas (`\"SWIMMING\"`).\n  - `wildlife_management_units`: This table might include data about wildlife management areas, possibly with an object identifier (`\"OBJECTID\"`), and an abbreviation (`\"ABNAME\"`).\n\n- **Columns selected**:\n  - The query selects a variety of columns from both tables, aiming to provide comprehensive details about the specified outdoor recreation site and its associated wildlife management unit.\n\n- **Join condition**:\n  - A left outer join is performed between `outdoor_recreation_sites_inventory` and `wildlife_management_units` based on matching `OBJECTID` values. This ensures that all records from the `outdoor_recreation_sites_inventory` are included, even if there is no corresponding record in the `wildlife_management_units` table.\n\n- **Where clause**:\n  - The `WHERE` clause filters the results to only include rows where the site name matches `'Example Site'` and the abbreviation for the wildlife management unit matches `'Example Agency'`. This narrows down the selection to a specific site managed by a specific agency.\n\n### Business scenario:\nThis SQL query is useful in scenarios where an organization needs to gather detailed information about a specific outdoor recreation site and its associated wildlife management practices or policies. For example, a park management team might use this query to prepare a report on a particular site's amenities, rules, and regulations enforced by the wildlife management agency.\n\n### User description:\nA user, perhaps a park manager or environmental officer, might need to quickly access and review all the details related to a specific recreation site, such as its location, available activities, and any special management guidelines set by the responsible wildlife agency. This could help in planning maintenance schedules, setting up educational programs, or ensuring compliance with environmental standards.",
