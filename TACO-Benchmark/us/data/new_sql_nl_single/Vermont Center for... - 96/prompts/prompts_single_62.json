    "problem_description": "### Query intent:\nThe SQL statement aims to retrieve specific data from two tables (`sga_phase_2_assessed_reaches` and `public_water_sources`) by performing an inner join based on a matching condition between their respective `RchID` and `RID` fields. The goal is to select records where the `FinalA` field in the `sga_phase_2_assessed_reaches` table has the value 'High', and then return the corresponding `SGAT_ID` from this table along with the `SystemName` from the `public_water_sources` table.\n\n### Detailed description:\n- **Tables involved**: \n    - `sga_phase_2_assessed_reaches`: This table likely contains information related to assessed reaches (possibly waterways) within a specific phase or project. It includes at least a column named `SGAT_ID` which serves as a unique identifier for each reach, and a `FinalA` field that might denote the final assessment level or criteria met.\n    - `public_water_sources`: This table appears to contain details about public water sources, possibly including a `SystemName` column that identifies different systems or sources of water.\n\n- **Join operation**: An `INNER JOIN` clause is used to combine rows from both tables based on matching values in the `RchID` column of `sga_phase_2_assessed_reaches` and the `RID` column of `public_water_sources`. This ensures that only records with matching identifiers are included in the result set.\n\n- **Selection criteria**:\n    - The `WHERE` clause filters the combined results to include only those rows where the `FinalA` field in the `sga_phase_2_assessed_reaches` table has the value 'High'. This implies that the SQL statement is looking for reaches that have been assessed at a high level of quality or compliance.\n\n### Business scenario:\nThis query could be utilized in a variety of environmental or water management contexts. For instance, it might be used by regulatory bodies, water utility companies, or environmental conservation organizations to identify high-quality water sources or reaches that have undergone rigorous assessment processes. This could be crucial for planning maintenance schedules, prioritizing resource allocation, or identifying areas for further improvement or protection.\n\n### User description:\nUsers might encounter situations where they need to analyze the status of various water sources or reaches based on predefined assessment criteria. For example, an environmental engineer or a water system manager might require a list of high-quality water sources that have been recently assessed and deemed to",
