    "problem_description": "### Query intent:\nThe SQL statement is designed to select specific data from a table named \"landslides\". It aims to retrieve two pieces of information: the values associated with columns labeled as \"X\" and \"Y\" for each row where the unique identifier (OBJECTID) matches a specific condition.\n\n### Detailed description:\n- **Table**: \"landslides\" - This table likely contains geographic data related to landslides, possibly including various attributes about landslide events such as their location, size, severity, and other characteristics.\n- **Columns**:\n    - `\"landslides.X\"` and `\"landslides.Y\"` - These refer to the X and Y coordinates, respectively, which are commonly used in geographic information systems (GIS) to denote the longitude and latitude of a point on the Earth's surface.\n- **Condition**:\n    - `\"landslides.OBJECTID\" = _ ;` - The underscore (_) represents a placeholder for a specific OBJECTID value. This condition filters the rows in the \"landslides\" table to only include those whose OBJECTID matches the specified value.\n\n### Business scenario:\nThis query could be used in various environmental monitoring or disaster management contexts, particularly when dealing with landslide data. For instance:\n\n1. **Environmental Impact Assessment**: Researchers might use this query to analyze the spatial distribution of past landslide events within a specific area, helping them understand patterns and potential risks.\n2. **Urban Planning**: City planners could employ this query to identify areas prone to landslides based on historical data, aiding in the development of zoning laws, infrastructure planning, and emergency response strategies.\n3. **Disaster Response**: Emergency management teams might use the results to quickly locate recent landslide events during an ongoing disaster, enabling rapid response and evacuation efforts.\n\n### User description:\nA user might need this information when they want to:\n- **Analyze trends**: By examining the locations of landslides over time, researchers can identify areas with high recurrence rates, which might indicate underlying environmental issues.\n- **Plan interventions**: Planners might require precise coordinates of landslide-prone zones to implement measures like slope stabilization, construction of barriers, or relocation of vulnerable populations.\n- **Emergency response coordination**: During a disaster, having up-to-date information on the exact locations of recent landslides can help in directing rescue operations efficiently, saving lives and resources.",
