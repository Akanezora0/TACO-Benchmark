    "problem_description": "### Query intent:\nThe SQL statement aims to retrieve specific data from two tables (`salt_storage_record_table` and `landslides`) based on a matching condition between their `OBJECTID` fields.\n\n### Detailed description:\n1. **Tables Involved**:\n   - **`salt_storage_record_table`**: This table likely contains records related to salt storage, including at least an `address_full` column for full address details and a `material_type` column specifying the type of material stored.\n   - **`landslides`**: This table seems to contain geographical data possibly related to landslides, with columns `X` and `Y` representing coordinates (likely longitude and latitude).\n\n2. **Columns Selected**:\n   - The query selects three columns: `address_full` from `salt_storage_record_table`, `material_type` from `salt_storage_record_table`, and `X` and `Y` from `landslides`. These columns suggest the query is interested in location details (`address_full` and coordinates), along with the material type stored.\n\n3. **Join Condition**:\n   - A `JOIN` operation is performed between `salt_storage_record_table` and `landslides` using the `OBJECTID` field. This implies that there's a common identifier (`OBJECTID`) linking entries in both tables that share this identifier will be matched and combined in the result set.\n\n4. **Where Clause**:\n   - The `WHERE` clause filters the results by selecting only those rows where the `OBJECTID` in `salt_storage_record_table` matches the specified `_` value. This condition ensures that only records with a particular `OBJECTID` are included in the final output.\n\n### Business Scenario:\nThis query might be used in a scenario where a company or organization needs to monitor the location of its salt storage facilities in relation to potential landslide areas. For example, they might want to assess whether any of their storage locations are near areas prone to landslides, which could pose risks to the safety of the storage facility and the materials stored.\n\n### User Description:\nA user might need to perform this query if they are tasked with conducting a risk assessment for their company's salt storage facilities. Specifically, they might need to know the exact locations (addresses) and types of materials stored at facilities that are located near or potentially within the vicinity of areas identified as high-risk for landslides. This information would help them plan safety measures, such as relocating certain materials to safer locations or implementing emergency response protocols for these specific sites.",
