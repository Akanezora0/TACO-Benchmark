    "problem_description": "### Query intent:\nThe SQL statement aims to retrieve specific attributes from two related tables, `lakepond_wbids_and_wbid_segments` and `outdoor_recreation_sites_inventory`. The intention is to combine these attributes into a single result set for further analysis or reporting.\n\n### Detailed description:\n1. **Tables Involved**: \n   - `lakepond_wbids_and_wbid_segments`: This table likely contains identifiers (`OBJECTID`, `Source`, `WBID`) related to some geographical features or segments within a lake or pond environment.\n   - `outdoor_recreation_sites_inventory`: This table appears to contain detailed information about outdoor recreation sites, including coordinates (`X`, `Y`), site details (`OBJECTID`, `MAP`, `MAP_NUMBER`, `SITE_NAME`, etc.), contact information, and various recreational activities supported (`BOATING_MA`, `CAMPING`, `GOLF`, etc.).\n\n2. **Columns Selected**:\n   - From `lakepond_wbids_and_wbid_segments`: `OBJECTID`, `Source`, `WBID`.\n   - From `outdoor_recreation_sites_inventory`: A comprehensive list of columns detailing site information, activities, and contact data.\n\n3. **Conditions/Joins**:\n   The query does not explicitly show joins or conditions linking the two tables. However, given the overlapping `OBJECTID` column in both tables, it's implied that there might be an implicit join on this column, which links records with matching `OBJECTID` values across both tables.\n\n### Business Scenario:\nThis query could be used in scenarios where there is a need to integrate data from different sources related to geographical locations and their associated outdoor recreational activities. For example, in environmental management, urban planning, or tourism development, such integration would allow for a more comprehensive view of available recreational resources and their accessibility.\n\n### User Description:\nUsers might require this information for various purposes, such as:\n- **Resource Allocation**: Identifying areas with high demand for specific recreational activities to allocate resources efficiently (e.g., building more boat ramps, improving hiking trails).\n- **Environmental Impact Assessment**: Understanding how different recreational activities affect local ecosystems and wildlife.\n- **Policy Making**: Informing policies related to conservation, access, and safety in outdoor recreation areas.\n- **Marketing and Promotion**: Targeting marketing efforts towards underutilized sites or promoting areas with unique features to attract visitors.",
