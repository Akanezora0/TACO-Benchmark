These coordinates are selected based on a condition where they are associated with records in another table (`landslides`) that have the same OBJECTID.\n\n### Detailed description:\n1. **Main Table**: `outdoor_recreation_sites_inventory`\n   - This table contains inventory data for outdoor recreation sites, likely including their unique identifiers (OBJECTID), geographical coordinates (X, Y), and possibly other attributes like site names, types, etc.\n\n2. **Nested Subquery**:\n   - The subquery is used to filter out unique OBJECTIDs from `outdoor_recreation_sites_inventory` that have matching OBJECTIDs in the `landslides` table.\n   - It selects distinct OBJECTIDs from `outdoor_recreation_sites_inventory` where there exists at least one record in `landslides` with the same OBJECTID.\n\n3. **Join Condition**:\n   - The main query uses the result of the subquery as a condition to filter rows in `outdoor_recreation_sites_inventory`. This means it will only return rows where the OBJECTID matches the unique OBJECTIDs found in both `outdoor_recreation_sites_inventory` and `landslides`.\n\n### Business scenario:\nThis query could be used in a scenario where environmental studies or monitoring are being conducted around outdoor recreation sites. For example, if there's a concern about landslides affecting these sites, this query would help identify which specific sites are potentially at risk by linking them through a common identifier (OBJECTID) to landslide occurrences.\n\n### User description:\nA user might need this information to:\n- **Plan safety measures**: Identify which outdoor recreation sites are near areas prone to landslides, allowing for better planning of safety protocols and emergency responses.\n- **Environmental impact assessment**: Assess the potential impact of landslides on recreational activities and natural habitats within these sites.\n- **Data analysis**: Combine this spatial data with other datasets (like topography, weather patterns, etc.) to perform comprehensive analyses on site vulnerability to natural disasters.\n\n### Additional considerations:\n- **Data consistency**: Ensuring that the OBJECTID field is consistently used across both tables is crucial for accurate results.\n- **Performance implications**: Large datasets could make this query resource-intensive, potentially impacting system performance. Optimizations might include indexing the OBJECTID field or using more efficient query techniques like JOINs if applicable.\n- **Data integrity**: The integrity of the OBJECTID across both tables should be",
