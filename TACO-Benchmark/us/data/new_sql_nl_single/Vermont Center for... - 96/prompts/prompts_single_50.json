    "problem_description": "### Query intent:\nThe SQL statement aims to retrieve specific data from two tables, \"landslides\" and \"landfills\", based on their spatial coordinates (X and Y), with the intention of examining details related to landslides for a particular object ID.\n\n### Detailed description:\n- **Table \"landslides\"** contains the following columns:\n  - `OBJECTID`: Unique identifier for each landslide record.\n  - `FIELD_VISIT`: Information about field visits conducted at the location of the landslide.\n  - `VISIT_DATE`: Date of the field visit.\n  - `ORGANIZATION`: The organization responsible for the field visit.\n  - `STYLE_FAIL`: Description of the failure style or type of the landslide.\n  - `LS_TYPE1` and `LS_TYPE2`: Types of the landslide, possibly categorized into two levels of detail.\n  - `WIDTH_M`: Width of the landslide area in meters.\n\n- **Table \"landfills\"** likely contains similar or related spatial data, but its exact schema is not detailed here. However, it's implied that this table shares columns like `X` and `Y` for spatial coordinates.\n\n- **JOIN condition**: The `ON` clause specifies that records from both tables must match exactly on their `X` and `Y` coordinates to be included in the result set. This suggests an attempt to correlate landslide events with potential locations of landfills or other geographical features.\n\n- **WHERE clause**: Specifies that only rows where `OBJECTID` equals 1 should be returned. This filters the results to include only data associated with the landslide identified by `OBJECTID` equal to 1.\n\n### Business scenario:\nThis query could be used in environmental monitoring or disaster management contexts to analyze the relationship between landslides and nearby facilities such as landfills. For instance, researchers might want to understand if there is any correlation between landslides and the presence or operation of landfills in a specific area.\n\n### User description:\nA user working in environmental science or urban planning might need this information to assess risks associated with natural disasters and human activities. They could use the data to identify potentially hazardous areas near landfills, which might require special attention or mitigation measures due to increased risk of landslides.\n\n### Additional considerations:\n- **Spatial indexing**: For efficient querying, especially when dealing with large datasets, spatial indexes on the `X` and `Y` columns of both tables would significantly speed up the JOIN operation.\n- **Data integrity**: Ensuring that the `X` and `Y",
