    "problem_description": "### Query intent:\nThe SQL statement aims to retrieve specific pieces of information from two related tables: `salt_storage_record_table` and `sand_and_gravel_deposits`. It seeks to join these tables based on a common identifier (`OBJECTID`) and filter the results based on a specific condition related to the type of deposit found in the `sand_and-gravel-deposits` table.\n\n### Detailed description:\n- **Tables Involved**:\n  - `salt_storage_record_table`: This table likely contains records about salt storage locations, possibly including details such as addresses (`address_full`).\n  - `sand_and_gravel_deposits`: This table seems to contain geographical data related to sand and gravel deposits, including their areas (`SHAPEarea`) and types (`AG_TYPE`).\n\n- **Columns Selected**:\n  - `salt_storage_record_table.address_full`: The full address for each salt storage location.\n  - `sand_and-gravel-deposits.SHAPEarea`: The area of the corresponding sand and gravel deposit.\n\n- **Join Condition**:\n  - `salt_storage_record_table.OBJECTID = sand_and-gravel-deposits.OBJECTID`: This condition is used to join the two tables together, assuming that each row in `salt_storage_record_table` corresponds to a specific deposit identified by `OBJECTID` in `sand_and-gravel-deposits`.\n\n- **Filtering Condition**:\n  - `sand_and-gravel-deposits.AG_TYPE = '类型值'`: Only rows where the `AG_TYPE` column matches the specified value (e.g., `'类型值'` could represent a specific type of deposit) are included in the result set.\n\n### Business Scenario:\nThis query might be useful in scenarios where one needs to correlate the geographical locations of salt storage with nearby sand and gravel deposits, particularly when there's an interest in the type of deposit (e.g., for potential environmental impact assessments, resource management planning, or logistical considerations related to proximity to raw material sources).\n\n### User Description:\nA user might need this information to plan the logistics of transporting salt to various storage locations efficiently, considering the potential use of nearby sand and gravel deposits. For instance, if certain types of deposits are known to have higher quality or lower environmental impact, the user might want to optimize storage locations based on their proximity to those types of deposits. Additionally, this data could help in conducting comprehensive site assessments or in making decisions about the potential use of the deposits for other purposes, such as blending materials or assessing the",
