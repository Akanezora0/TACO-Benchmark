It uses a subquery to find a specific `X` value and then matches this value with the `X` column in the same table.\n\n### Business scenario:\nThis query might be used in a situation where you need to retrieve details about a specific outdoor recreation site based on an identifier (`X`). For instance, if you have a system tracking various outdoor sites for activities like hiking, camping, or fishing, and you need to fetch information about a particular site identified by its unique code or number.\n\n### User description:\nA user might need to access detailed information about a specific outdoor recreation site for planning purposes. For example, they could be looking for details such as location, amenities, entry fees, or opening hours for a site they plan to visit. By providing the unique identifier (`X`) of the site, they can execute this query to get all relevant information about that site from the database.",
