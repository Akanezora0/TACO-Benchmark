    "problem_description": "### Query intent:\nThe SQL statement aims to retrieve the latitude and longitude data from two tables: `landfills` and `outdoor_recreation_sites_inventory`. The goal is to join these tables based on a common identifier, `OBJECTID`, and select specific columns from each table.\n\n### Detailed description:\n- **Tables involved**:\n    - **landfills**: This table contains information about landfill locations, including at least an `OBJECTID` column and `LATITUDE` and `LONGITUDE` columns for geographical coordinates.\n    - **outdoor_recreation_sites_inventory**: This table includes details about outdoor recreation sites, also with an `OBJECTID` column, as well as `LATITUDE` and `LONGITUDE` for their geographical locations.\n- **Columns selected**:\n    - From the `landfills` table, selects the `LATITUDE` and `LONGITUDE` columns.\n    - From the `outdoor_recreation_sites_inventory` table, the query does not explicitly select any columns, suggesting it might be intended to join without selecting anything from this table.\n- **Join condition**:\n    - `landfills.\"OBJECTID\" = outdoor_recreation_sites_inventory.\"OBJECTID\"`: This condition ensures that only rows where the `OBJECTID` matches between the two tables are included in the result set. It's likely that there is a relationship between landfill locations and outdoor recreation sites, such as proximity or shared properties.\n\n### Business scenario:\nThis query could be useful in scenarios where environmental impact assessments are required for outdoor recreation areas near landfill sites. For example, local governments or conservation agencies might need to understand the spatial relationship between potential sites for new parks or recreational activities and existing landfill sites to evaluate potential environmental impacts, safety concerns, or planning considerations.\n\n### User description:\nA user, possibly an environmental scientist or urban planner, might need this information to analyze the proximity of new outdoor recreation sites to existing landfill sites. They might be concerned about the potential for pollution dispersion, ecological impacts, or public health risks associated with these locations. By querying the latitude and longitude of both types of sites, they can create maps or perform spatial analysis to make informed decisions about site selection or remediation efforts.",
