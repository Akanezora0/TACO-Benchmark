This ensures that only records where there's a match between the `OBJECTID` in `outdoor_recreation_sites_inventory` and `OBJECTID` in `lakepond_wbids_and_wbid_segments` are included in the result set.\n\n- **WHERE clause**:\n  - Filters the combined data to include only those records where the `EventType` column in `lakepond_wbids_and_wbid_segments` equals 'Boating'. This narrows down the results to sites that offer Boating activities.\n\n### Business scenario:\nThis query is typically used in a context where administrators or users need to identify which outdoor recreation sites offer Boating activities. It could be part of a larger system designed to manage or promote recreational activities at various locations.\n\n### User description:\nA user might encounter this need when planning events or activities, looking for locations that provide specific services (like Boating), or when creating directories or guides for visitors interested in water-based recreational activities. By executing this SQL query, they can efficiently find all relevant sites without having to manually sift through extensive data.",
