    "problem_description": "### Query intent:\nThe SQL statement is designed to select all records from the \"landslides\" table where the \"STYLE_FAIL\" column has either 'type1' or 'type2' as its value.\n\n### Detailed description:\n- **Table**: The primary table involved in this query is \"landslides\". This table presumably contains data related to landslides, likely including attributes such as style of failure (as denoted by the \"STYLE_FAIL\" column).\n- **Columns**:\n    - `\"landslides.STYLE_FAIL\"`: This is the column we're querying on. It holds various styles of landslide failures, which are being filtered based on the values 'type1' and 'type2'.\n- **Conditions**:\n    - `\"landslides.STYLE_FAIL\" = 'type1'`: This condition filters for rows where the style of failure is specifically 'type1'.\n    - `\"landslides.STYLE_FAIL\" = 'type2'`: This condition further filters for rows where the style of failure is specifically 'type2'. The OR operator combines these two conditions, meaning the query will return rows where the style of failure is either 'type1' or 'type2'.\n- **Joins**: Not mentioned in the query, but it's implied that no additional tables are joined to the \"landslides\" table since there are no JOIN clauses present.\n- **Sorting**: There are no ORDER BY or LIMIT clauses, so the result set will not be sorted or limited in any way.\n\n### Business scenario:\nThis query can be used in scenarios where an analyst or decision-maker needs to inspect or analyze all landslide failures that have occurred in a specific category (either 'type1' or 'type2') within a dataset. This could be useful for risk assessment, planning mitigation strategies, or studying particular types of landslide behavior.\n\n### User description:\nA user might need this information to understand the frequency, patterns, or impacts of landslides that occur due to specific failure modes ('type1' or 'type2'). For instance, if 'type1' refers to landslides caused by erosion and 'type2' to those caused by seismic activity, the user could use this query to compare the effects of these two causes on the environment, infrastructure, or communities. This analysis could inform policy decisions, emergency response protocols, or long-term environmental management strategies.",
