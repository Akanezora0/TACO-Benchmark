    "problem_description": "### Query intent:\nThe SQL statement aims to retrieve specific details from a dataset related to wetland ecologists and their districts, focusing on records where the material type is salt, the storage duration exceeds 10 years, and there exists at least one record indicating the presence of salt on a pad for each unique district.\n\n### Detailed description:\n- **Tables involved**: The query involves two tables - `salt_storage_record_table` (SSRT) and `wetland_ecologist_districts` (WED). SSRT contains detailed records about storage activities, while WED provides metadata about the districts.\n- **Columns selected**:\n  - `OBJECTID`: A unique identifier for each district in the WED table.\n  - `AGENCY`: The agency responsible for the wetland ecologist's work in the district.\n  - `ABNAME`: An abbreviation or name for the agency.\n- **Join condition**: The query uses an INNER JOIN clause to link rows from SSRT and WED based on the common column `FULCRUM_ID`. This ensures that only those records from SSRT that have a matching `FULCRUM_ID` in WED are considered.\n- **Where clause**:\n  - `ssr.material_type = 'Salt'`: Filters records to include only those where the material stored is salt.\n  - `ssr.storage_length_years > 10`: Requires the storage duration to exceed 10 years.\n  - `EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM salt_storage_record_table sst WHERE sst.fulcrum_id = w.OBJECTID AND sst.material_on_pad = 'Yes')`: Checks if there exists at least one record in SSRT for each district (matched by `FULCRUM_ID`) where the material is on a pad (`material_on_pad = 'Yes'`). This ensures that the query includes districts with at least one instance of salt being stored on a pad.\n\n### Business scenario:\nThis query is useful in environmental management or compliance checks for areas where wetlands are managed or protected. It helps identify districts (or specific locations) where there has been significant storage of salt (potentially for de-icing or other purposes) for over 10 years, and where salt has been observed on pads. This could be crucial for assessing potential environmental impacts, such as soil salinization, or for planning remediation actions.\n\n### User description:\nA conservation officer or an environmental engineer might need this information to:\n- Evaluate the long-term effects of salt storage practices on local",
