    "problem_description": "### Query intent:\nThe SQL statement aims to retrieve specific data from two tables: `landslides` and `waste_water_facilities`. It appears to be selecting certain columns (`\"landslides.X\"` and `\"landslides.Y\"`) from the `landslides` table and excluding records found in the `waste_water_facilities` table.\n\n### Detailed description:\n- **Tables**: The query involves two tables, `landslides` and `waste_water_facilities`.\n    - **landslides**: This table likely contains information related to landslides, possibly including geographical coordinates, landslide characteristics, or event details.\n    - **waste_water_facilities**: This table might contain information about waste water facilities, such as their locations or operational details.\n- **Columns**:\n    - `\"landslides.X\"` and `\"landslides.Y\"` suggest that these are columns within the `landslides` table, potentially representing coordinates (X and Y could denote longitude and latitude).\n- **Conditions**: The `-` operator in the context of SQL is not standard for joining tables or performing subtractions. It's likely intended to exclude records from one table that match any record in the other table, effectively performing a LEFT JOIN followed by a WHERE clause to filter out unwanted rows. However, this syntax is unconventional and might require clarification or correction for accurate interpretation.\n\n### Business scenario:\nThis query could be part of an environmental monitoring system or disaster response planning where one is interested in comparing or analyzing landslide occurrences against the presence of waste water facilities. For example:\n\n- **Scenario**: A government agency or environmental organization wants to assess the potential impact of waste water facilities on areas prone to landslides.\n- **Purpose**: Identify if any waste water facilities are located near landslide-prone areas, which could indicate potential environmental hazards or risks for facility operations during extreme weather events.\n\n### User description:\nUsers might encounter situations where they need to ensure that critical infrastructure like waste water facilities is appropriately sited away from natural hazards such as landslides. This query helps in identifying potential overlap between the two datasets, guiding decisions on facility location, safety measures, and compliance with environmental regulations.\n\n### Note:\nThe unconventional use of the `-` operator suggests there might be a misunderstanding or typo in the SQL statement. Typically, to achieve the described functionality, a LEFT JOIN would be used to combine the two tables, followed by a WHERE clause to filter out records based on specific conditions, rather than using `-` directly in the SELECT statement.",
