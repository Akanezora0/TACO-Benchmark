The goal is to retrieve specific details about these intersections.\n\n### Detailed description:\n1. **Tables Involved**:\n   - **`dfirm_floodways`**: This table likely contains records related to floodways, with at least an `OBJECTID` (unique identifier for each record) and a `DFIRM_ID`.\n   - **`outdoor_recreation_sites_inventory`**: This table includes records about outdoor recreation sites, featuring an `OBJECTID` (for uniqueness), and `X` and `Y` coordinates which represent the geographical location of each site.\n\n2. **Columns Selected**:\n   - **`dfirm_floodways.OBJECTID`**: Retrieves the unique identifier for each floodway record.\n   - **`dfirm_floodways.DFIRM_ID`**: Retrieves a specific identifier associated with each floodway record, possibly related to its classification or management.\n   - **`outdoor_recreation_sites_inventory.X` and `outdoor_recreation_sites_inventory.Y`**: Retrieves the X and Y coordinates for each outdoor recreation site, providing their geographical locations.\n\n3. **Join Condition**:\n   - **`dfirm_floodways.FLD_AR_ID = outdoor_recreation_sites_inventory.OBJECTID`**: This condition ensures that only those floodway records are selected where there exists a corresponding outdoor recreation site based on matching `OBJECTID` values. `FLD_AR_ID` might be an alias for `dfirm_floodways.FLD_AR_ID`, indicating a field within the `dfirm_floodways` table that links it to the `OBJECTID` in the `outdoor_recreation_sites_inventory`.\n\n### Business Scenario:\nThis query is particularly useful in urban planning or environmental management contexts. For instance, it could be employed to identify floodways that intersect with or are near outdoor recreation sites. This information can help in assessing potential risks to recreational activities during flood events, guiding decisions on safety measures, or planning for infrastructure improvements that mitigate flood impacts on these areas.\n\n### User Description:\nA city planner or environmental scientist might use this query to analyze flood risks at popular outdoor recreation sites such as parks, trails, or beaches. By identifying floodways close to these sites, they can prioritize areas for risk mitigation strategies, such as setting up warning systems, creating emergency evacuation plans",
