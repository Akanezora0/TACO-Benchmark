It ensures that only those water sources with corresponding invasive species observations are included in the result set.\n   - **WHERE clause**:\n     - `public_water_sources.SystemStatus = 'Active'`: This condition filters out any inactive water sources, ensuring that only currently operational sources are considered.\n     - `invasive_species.TreatmentEffectiveness = 'High'`: This condition filters invasive species observations based on the effectiveness of treatments applied, specifically looking for cases where treatments have been highly effective.\n\n### Business scenario:\nThis query is useful in environmental management and conservation efforts, particularly in aquatic ecosystems. It helps in identifying active water sources that have experienced high-effectiveness treatments against invasive species. This information can be crucial for:\n- **Monitoring and Assessment**: To track the progress of invasive species control efforts across different water bodies.\n- **Strategic Planning**: To prioritize resources and interventions at locations where treatments have been successful, potentially indicating more effective strategies or outcomes.\n- **Policy Making**: To inform policies regarding water management, treatment efficacy, and resource allocation for environmental protection.\n\n### User description:\nA user, possibly an environmental scientist or a policy maker, might need this information to evaluate the success of recent invasive species management projects, plan future interventions, or allocate resources more effectively based on past treatment outcomes. The ability to pinpoint active water sources with high-effectiveness treatments allows for targeted follow-up studies or maintenance actions to ensure continued effectiveness or to replicate successful",
