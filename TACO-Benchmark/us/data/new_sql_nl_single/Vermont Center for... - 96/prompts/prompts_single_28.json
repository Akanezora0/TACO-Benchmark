    "problem_description": "### Query intent:\nThe SQL statement is designed to retrieve specific details from two related tables: `outdoor_recreation_sites_inventory` and `wetland_ecologist_districts`. The primary goal is to find information about outdoor recreation sites that fall within a particular wetland ecologist district, as defined by the agency and town.\n\n### Detailed description:\n1. **Tables involved**: The query involves two tables - `outdoor_recreation_sites_inventory` and `wetland_ecologist_districts`. \n   - `outdoor_recreation_sites_inventory`: This table likely contains data about various outdoor recreation sites, with columns such as `X`, `Y` (coordinates), `OBJECTID` (a unique identifier for each record), and `MAP` (possibly a reference to a map or location details).\n   - `wetland_ecologist_districts`: This table seems to contain data about districts managed by wetland ecologists, including columns like `FIPS_CODE` (a code identifying each district), `AGENCY` (the managing agency), and `Town` (the town associated with the district).\n\n2. **Columns selected**: The query selects four columns from the `outdoor_recreation_sites_inventory` table (`X`, `Y`, `OBJECTID`, `MAP`) along with matching records from `wetland_ecologist_districts`.\n\n3. **Join condition**: The `JOIN` clause links the two tables based on the `FIPS_CODE` column in `wetland_ecologist_districts` and the `OBJECTID` column in `outdoor_recreation_sites_inventory`.\n\n4. **Where clause**: The `WHERE` clause filters the results based on the `AGENCY` being 'AgencyName' and the `Town` being 'TownName'. This ensures that only records pertaining to the specified agency and town are returned.\n\n### Business scenario:\nThis query is particularly useful in scenarios where there is a need to analyze or manage outdoor recreation sites within a specific wetland ecologist district. For example, park management, tourism planning, or environmental conservation efforts might require detailed information about available recreation sites within a given jurisdiction.\n\n### User description:\nUsers might face situations where they need to plan new recreational activities, assess existing facilities, or conduct environmental impact assessments within a designated area managed by a specific agency. By executing this SQL query, they can obtain precise coordinates, identifiers, and possibly additional map references for all relevant outdoor recreation sites, facilitating informed decision-making and resource allocation.",
