    "problem_description": "### Query intent:\nThe SQL statement aims to retrieve specific information from two related tables, `lakepond_wbids_and_wbid_segments` and `landslides`, by performing an inner join operation on their corresponding IDs.\n\n### Detailed description:\n1. **Tables involved**:\n   - **`lakepond_wbids_and_wbid_segments`**: This table likely contains segments of geographic features or data related to lake ponds. It includes at least one column `OBJECTID` which uniquely identifies each segment.\n   - **`landslides`**: This table is presumably associated with landslide data. It also includes an `OBJECTID` column for unique identification, alongside a `GlobalID` column, which might be used for linking this table with others or referencing it in external systems.\n\n2. **Join condition**:\n   - The `INNER JOIN` clause is used to combine rows from both tables based on matching values between `WBID` (from `lakepond_wbids_and_wbid_segments`) and `GlobalID` (from `landslides`). This ensures that only records where these identifiers match are included in the result set.\n\n3. **Selected columns**:\n   - The query specifically selects `OBJECTID` from both tables (`lakepond_wbids_and_wbid_segments.OBJECTID` and `landslides.OBJECTID`). This suggests that the user is interested in identifying which segments of lake pond data are also linked to landslide occurrences within the system.\n\n### Business scenario:\nThis query could be used in environmental management or geographical analysis to correlate specific segments of lake pond data with potential landslide risks. For instance, in a project focused on understanding the impact of lake pond segments on local geology or in planning mitigation strategies for landslides.\n\n### User description:\nA user working in environmental science or urban planning might need to identify and analyze specific areas (represented by `OBJECTID`s) where lake ponds exist and where there is a risk of landslides. By running this query, they can efficiently cross-reference these areas against known landslide data, facilitating targeted studies or interventions.",
