    "problem_description": "### Query intent:\nThe SQL statement aims to find a specific relationship between two datasets: `dfirm_floodways` and `sand_and_gravel_deposits`. It seeks to identify which floodway records (`OBJECTID` from `dfirm_floodways`) are associated with sand and gravel deposits (`GlobalID` from `sand_and_gravel_deposits`). This could be useful for environmental studies or urban planning where the interaction between floodways and geological features is relevant.\n\n### Detailed description:\n- **Table `dfirm_floodways`**:\n    - **Column `OBJECTID`**: A unique identifier for each record in this table, likely representing a specific location or feature within a floodway system.\n    - **Column `HYDRO_ID`**: A reference field that might link this floodway record to other related data, such as hydrological models or geographical identifiers.\n\n- **Table `sand_and_gravel_deposits`**:\n    - **Column `GlobalID`**: A unique identifier for each record in this table, potentially representing a specific location or deposit of sand and gravel.\n    - **Column `AG_TYPE`**: An attribute that categorizes or identifies the type of geological feature, possibly used here to match with the `HYDRO_ID` from `dfirm_floodways`.\n\n- **Join condition** (`dfirm_floodways.HYDRO_ID = sand_and_gravel_deposits.AG_TYPE`): This condition links records from both tables based on a matching identifier between the floodway system's hydrological ID and the geological feature's type. The equality comparison ensures that only those floodways directly associated with sand and gravel deposits are selected.\n\n### Business scenario:\nThis query could be used in several business contexts, such as:\n\n1. **Environmental Impact Assessment**: To identify floodways that cross over or are near sand and gravel deposits, which might influence flood management strategies or require special considerations during construction or maintenance.\n2. **Urban Planning**: For zoning decisions or infrastructure planning around areas prone to flooding but also rich in natural resources like sand and gravel, which are crucial for construction materials.\n3. **Geological Survey**: To analyze the distribution of sand and gravel deposits in relation to existing or planned floodway systems, aiding in understanding potential environmental impacts or resource utilization.\n\n### User description:\nA user might need this information to make informed decisions about land use, environmental protection measures, or infrastructure development plans. For example, an urban planner could use this data to determine if new developments should",
