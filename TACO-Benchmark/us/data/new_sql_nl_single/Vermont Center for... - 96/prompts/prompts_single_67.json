    "problem_description": "### Query intent:\nThe SQL statement is designed to retrieve specific data from two related tables (`wildlife_management_units` and `public_water_sources`) with the goal of identifying which `OBJECTID` (a unique identifier for each entry) in the `wildlife_management_units` table corresponds to a `WellType` of 'Aquifer' in the `public_water_sources` table.\n\n### Detailed description:\n1. **Table and Columns Involved:**\n   - **`wildlife_management_units`** contains at least an `OBJECTID` column, which serves as a primary key for uniquely identifying each record in this table.\n   - **`public_water_sources`** has a `WellType` column, which categorizes different types of water sources, including but not limited to 'Aquifer'.\n   - The `BOUNDARY` column in `wildlife_management_units` likely corresponds to a condition or feature in `public_water_sources` that links these two tables.\n\n2. **Join Operation:**\n   - An **INNER JOIN** is performed between `wildlife_management_units` and `public_water_sources` based on the matching values in the `BOUNDARY` column of `wildlife_management_units` and the `WellType` column of `public_water_sources`. This ensures that only records where these two columns match are included in the result set.\n\n3. **Where Clause:**\n   - The **WHERE** clause filters the results to only include those rows where the `WellType` in the `public_water_sources` table is specifically 'Aquifer'. This narrows down the focus to a particular type of water source.\n\n### Business Scenario:\nThis SQL query might be useful in environmental management or conservation efforts. For instance, it could help identify specific areas within wildlife management units that have access to aquifer resources. This information could be crucial for planning water extraction limits, assessing the impact of water usage on wildlife habitats, or determining areas for potential water conservation initiatives.\n\n### User Description:\nA wildlife conservation officer or an environmental scientist might need this information to understand the distribution and accessibility of groundwater resources within protected areas. This could inform decisions on sustainable resource management, habitat protection, or ecological restoration projects. By knowing which parts of their management units have aquifer water sources, they can make more informed choices about how to allocate resources and plan interventions that are both effective and environmentally responsible.",
