For instance, it might help in tracking if a particular landfill is being treated by a specific waste water facility or if there are any discrepancies in the reported facilities treating a given landfill.\n\n### User description:\nA user, perhaps an environmental regulator or a compliance officer, might need this information to ensure that all landfills are properly connected with certified waste water treatment facilities as part of environmental regulations. They could use this query to verify the accuracy of facility reports, identify unregistered connections, or plan audits based on the facilities associated with certain landfills.",
