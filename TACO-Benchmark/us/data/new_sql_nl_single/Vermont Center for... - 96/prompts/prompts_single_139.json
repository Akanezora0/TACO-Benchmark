The primary goal is to find records where the type of activity (`AG_TYPE`) in `sand_and_gravel_deposits` is set to 'strict', and then match these records with corresponding floodway data in `dfirm_floodways`.\n\n### Detailed description:\n- **Table `sand_and_gravel_deposits`**:\n    - **Columns**:\n        - `OBJECTID`: A unique identifier for each record in this table.\n        - `AG_TYPE`: Indicates the type of activity or operation performed (in this case, 'strict').\n    - **Role**: This table contains detailed information about sand and gravel deposits, including their types.\n\n- **Table `dfirm_floodways`**:\n    - **Columns**:\n        - `FLOODWAY`: Identifies the specific floodway being referenced.\n        - `FLD_AR_ID`: An identifier that links records in this table back to the appropriate deposit record in `sand_and_gravel_deposits`.\n    - **Role**: This table provides information about floodways, particularly which ones might intersect or be affected by sand and gravel operations.\n\n- **Join condition** (`sand_and_gravel_deposits.GlobalID = dfirm_floodways.FLD_AR_ID`): This condition ensures that only those sand and gravel deposit records that have a matching floodway ID in `dfirm_floodways` are selected.\n\n- **Where clause** (`sand_and_gravel_deposits.AG_TYPE = 'strict'`): This filters the results to include only those records where the activity type is specifically labeled as 'strict'.\n\n### Business scenario:\nThis query is useful in environmental management or urban planning contexts where the impact of sand and gravel extraction on local floodways needs to be assessed. For instance, it could help in identifying areas where strict regulations apply due to potential environmental concerns related to flood control.\n\n### User description:\nA user in an environmental regulatory agency or a construction planning department might need to quickly identify which sand and gravel extraction sites are subject to stringent regulations and how they relate to existing flood management infrastructure. This information is crucial for compliance checks, environmental impact assessments, or planning new construction projects that must avoid or mitigate risks associated with flood zones.",
