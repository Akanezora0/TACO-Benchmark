    "problem_description": "### Query intent:\nThe SQL statement aims to retrieve specific data by performing an inner join operation between two tables, `sga_phase_2_assessed_reaches` and `landslides`, based on a matching condition, and then filtering the results using a specific criterion.\n\n### Detailed description:\n1. **Tables involved**:\n   - **`sga_phase_2_assessed_reaches`**: This table likely contains information about reaches (segments) that have been assessed in phase 2 of some project or process. The columns mentioned in the SELECT clause (`SGAT_ID`) suggest it might store unique identifiers for these segments.\n   - **`landslides`**: This table seems to contain data related to landslides, possibly including unique identifiers (`OBJECTID`). The `RchID` column in this table could be used to link it with the `sga_phase_2_assessed_reaches` table.\n\n2. **Columns selected**:\n   - **`SGAT_ID`**: This is likely a unique identifier for the reaches that have undergone assessment in phase 2.\n   - **`landslides.OBJECTID`**: This represents the unique identifier for the landslide records. By selecting this column, the query aims to associate each reach with its corresponding landslide data.\n\n3. **Join condition**:\n   - `sga_phase_2_assessed_reaches.RchID = landslides.OBJECTID`: This condition ensures that only those reaches are included in the final result set where there exists a corresponding landslide record. The join effectively matches each reach with its associated landslide data based on the common identifier.\n\n4. **Filtering condition**:\n   - `sga_phase_2_assessed_reaches.FinalA = 'true'`: This condition filters the results to include only those reaches that have been marked as having reached a \"final\" state, specifically where `FinalA` equals 'true'. This could imply that the assessment phase for these reaches has concluded satisfactorily.\n\n### Business scenario:\nThis query is typically used in scenarios where environmental studies, particularly those involving landslides and their impact on infrastructure like roads or buildings, need to be closely monitored and managed. For example, after assessing multiple reaches for potential landslide risks, the system might flag those reaches that have passed all safety checks and are ready for final approval or implementation of mitigation measures.\n\n### User description:\nUsers who manage infrastructure projects or environmental monitoring programs might use this query to:\n- Quickly identify which reaches (segments of roads, pipelines, etc.)",
