  "problem_description": "### Query intent:\nThe SQL statement is designed to retrieve specific data from two tables, `landslides` and `wildlife_management_units`, with the primary goal of identifying records where the `FIELD_VISIT` field in the `landslides` table has a value of 'true'. The query aims to join these two datasets on their respective `OBJECTID` fields, which presumably serve as unique identifiers for each record.\n\n### Detailed description:\n1. **Table `landslides`**:\n   - This table contains data related to landslides. It likely includes multiple records, each representing a different landslide event.\n   - The column `OBJECTID` is used as a unique identifier for each landslide record.\n   - The column `FIELD_VISIT` is of interest here. Its value being 'true' indicates that a field visit (inspection, survey) has been conducted for that particular landslide event.\n\n2. **Table `wildlife_management_units`**:\n   - This table contains data about wildlife management units, such as protected areas or habitats. Each unit is uniquely identified by its `OBJECTID`.\n   - The relationship between `landslides` and `wildlife_management_units` might involve spatial or temporal overlap, suggesting that the landslides could potentially affect or intersect with these management units.\n\n3. **Join condition**:\n   - The `FROM \"landslides\" - \"wildlife_management_units\"` part seems to imply an operation to find records in `landslides` that do not have corresponding records in `wildlife_management_units`. However, the correct syntax for this operation is not standard SQL. Assuming it's meant to find rows in `landslides` that don't exist in `wildlife_management_units`, the actual join would look something like `INNER JOIN` or `LEFT JOIN` depending on the desired outcome. The correct interpretation here is that we are looking for records in `landslides` where there is no matching `OBJECTID` in `wildlife_management_units`.\n\n4. **WHERE clause**:\n   - `WHERE \"landslides.FIELD_VISIT\" = 'true'` filters the results to include only those rows from the `landslides` table where the `FIELD_VISIT` column has a value of 'true'. This means the query focuses on landslides that have been visited for inspection.\n\n### Business scenario:\nThis SQL query is useful in environmental monitoring and management contexts. For instance, in scenarios where it is necessary to assess the impact of landslides on wildlife habitats or protected areas. The query",
  "natural_language_query": "I'm trying to analyze the connection between landslides and wildlife conservation areas in our region. Specifically, I want to identify any landslides that have been inspected or visited recently, as indicated by the 'true' status in the 'FIELD_VISIT' column. Additionally, I'm interested in understanding if these landslides intersect with any designated wildlife management units. My goal is to ensure that our conservation efforts are not compromised by recent natural events. Could you help me run a query that fetches all such landslides and cross-references them against the wildlife management units database?",
