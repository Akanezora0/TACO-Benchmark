  "problem_description": "### Query intent:\nThe SQL statement aims to select specific data from the `sand_and_gravel_deposits` table based on a condition related to the attribute `AG_TYPE`.\n\n### Detailed description:\n1. **Table**: `sand_and_gravel_deposits` - This table is likely part of a database that contains information about sand and gravel deposits. It may include details such as deposit location, type, size, and other relevant attributes.\n\n2. **Columns**:\n   - `OBJECTID`: This column might represent a unique identifier for each record in the table, useful for referencing or linking records across different datasets.\n   - `GlobalID`: Another identifier, possibly unique across the entire system, which could be used for cross-referencing with other databases or systems.\n   - `AG_TYPE`: This column is expected to contain the type of deposit, here specifically filtered to only include records where `AG_TYPE` equals 'Quarry'.\n\n3. **Condition**: `sand_and_gravel_deposits.AG_TYPE = 'Quarry'` - The query filters the records in the `sand_and_gravel_deposits` table to only include those where the `AG_TYPE` attribute has the value 'Quarry'. This suggests that the user is interested in data pertaining to quarries specifically.\n\n### Business scenario:\nThis query could be used in various business contexts related to mining, construction materials management, environmental monitoring, or geographic information systems (GIS). For instance:\n\n- **Mining Industry**: Mining companies might use this query to analyze and manage their quarry operations, ensuring compliance with regulations, optimizing resource allocation, or conducting environmental impact assessments.\n  \n- **Construction Materials Supply Chain**: Construction firms or material suppliers could leverage this query to track inventory, monitor quarry productivity, or plan logistics based on the availability of specific types of sand and gravel.\n\n- **Government Regulatory Agencies**: Environmental or mining regulatory bodies might use this query to monitor compliance with environmental standards, assess the sustainability of quarry operations, or conduct audits.\n\n### User description:\nA user, perhaps an environmental scientist, an operations manager in a construction company, or a government inspector, might need to access detailed information about quarries within a specific area or under certain conditions. For example, they might require a list of all quarries within a designated region to evaluate their impact on local ecosystems or to ensure they are operating within legal guidelines.",
  "natural_language_query": "As an environmental scientist working on a project to assess the impact of sand and gravel extraction activities on local ecosystems, I am particularly interested in understanding the characteristics of quarries. Specifically, I would like to gather detailed information about quarries classified as 'Quarry' within our study area. Could you please provide me with a comprehensive list of these quarries, including their unique identifiers, Global IDs, and the type of deposit they represent? This information will be crucial for my analysis and for ensuring that our findings adhere to environmental protection standards.",
