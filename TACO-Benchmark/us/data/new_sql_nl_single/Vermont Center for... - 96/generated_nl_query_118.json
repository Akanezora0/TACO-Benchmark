  "problem_description": "### Query intent:\nThe SQL statement aims to retrieve specific information from two related tables: `sga_phase_2_assessed_reaches` and `landslides`. The primary goal is to join these two tables based on a common identifier (`RchID` in `sga_phase_2_assessed_reaches` and `OBJECTID` in `landslides`) and then select certain fields for output.\n\n### Detailed description:\n\n#### Tables and Columns:\n- **`sga_phase_2_assessed_reaches`**:\n    - `SGAT_ID`: A unique identifier for each record in this table.\n    - `RchID`: An identifier that links records in this table to corresponding records in the `landslides` table.\n\n- **`landslides`**:\n    - `OBJECTID`: A unique identifier for each landslide record.\n    - `X`, `Y`: Coordinates (possibly longitude and latitude) indicating the location of the landslide.\n\n#### Conditions:\n- The `INNER JOIN` clause is used to match rows in both tables where the `RchID` in `sga_phase_2_assessed_reaches` matches the `OBJECTID` in `landslides`.\n\n### Business Scenario:\nThis query is typically used in environmental or geographical studies focusing on landslides. It might be part of an analysis or monitoring system designed to correlate detailed reach assessments (e.g., waterway or road segments) with landslide occurrences.\n\n### User Description:\nA user might need this information to understand how specific areas (identified by their coordinates) have been assessed in terms of potential landslide risk. This could be crucial for planning infrastructure, conducting environmental impact assessments, or emergency preparedness in areas prone to landslides.\n\n### Additional Context:\nIn a broader context, this query enables the integration of different datasets—reach assessments with landslide data—to provide a comprehensive view of risk management strategies. For instance, it could help identify which sections of waterways or roads require immediate attention due to high landslide risk, based on previous assessments and current geographical locations of past events.",
  "natural_language_query": "As a data analyst working on environmental risk assessment projects, I often need to integrate various datasets to gain a comprehensive understanding of potential risks in specific areas. Recently, I've been tasked with analyzing landslides and their impacts on critical infrastructure like waterways and roads. To achieve this, I require a SQL query that allows me to join data from two tables: 'sga_phase_2_assessed_reaches' and 'landslides'. \n\nThe 'sga_phase_2_assessed_reaches' table contains detailed assessments of various reaches, including unique identifiers ('SGAT_ID') and another identifier ('RchID') that links these assessments to geographical locations. On the other hand, the 'landslides' table holds data on past events, including unique identifiers ('OBJECTID'), and geographical coordinates ('X', 'Y').\n\nTo effectively analyze the correlation between these two datasets, I aim to create an SQL query that performs an INNER JOIN operation on the 'RchID' field from 'sga_phase_2_assessed_reaches' and the 'OBJECTID' field from 'landslides'. This will enable me to retrieve records that correspond to areas where past landslides have occurred, allowing for a detailed examination of risk assessments in those specific locations.\n\nThe ultimate goal is to identify areas that have been previously assessed for potential landslide risk and cross-reference them with actual landslide occurrences. This information can be crucial for developing targeted interventions, improving infrastructure safety, and enhancing emergency response plans in areas prone to landslides.",
