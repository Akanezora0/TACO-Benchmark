  "problem_description": "### Query intent:\nThe SQL statement aims to retrieve specific details from a dataset related to wetland ecologists and their districts, focusing on records where the material type is salt, the storage duration exceeds 10 years, and there exists at least one record indicating the presence of salt on a pad for each unique district.\n\n### Detailed description:\n- **Tables involved**: The query involves two tables - `salt_storage_record_table` (SSRT) and `wetland_ecologist_districts` (WED). SSRT contains detailed records about storage activities, while WED provides metadata about the districts.\n- **Columns selected**:\n  - `OBJECTID`: A unique identifier for each district in the WED table.\n  - `AGENCY`: The agency responsible for the wetland ecologist's work in the district.\n  - `ABNAME`: An abbreviation or name for the agency.\n- **Join condition**: The query uses an INNER JOIN clause to link rows from SSRT and WED based on the common column `FULCRUM_ID`. This ensures that only those records from SSRT that have a matching `FULCRUM_ID` in WED are considered.\n- **Where clause**:\n  - `ssr.material_type = 'Salt'`: Filters records to include only those where the material stored is salt.\n  - `ssr.storage_length_years > 10`: Requires the storage duration to exceed 10 years.\n  - `EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM salt_storage_record_table sst WHERE sst.fulcrum_id = w.OBJECTID AND sst.material_on_pad = 'Yes')`: Checks if there exists at least one record in SSRT for each district (matched by `FULCRUM_ID`) where the material is on a pad (`material_on_pad = 'Yes'`). This ensures that the query includes districts with at least one instance of salt being stored on a pad.\n\n### Business scenario:\nThis query is useful in environmental management or compliance checks for areas where wetlands are managed or protected. It helps identify districts (or specific locations) where there has been significant storage of salt (potentially for de-icing or other purposes) for over 10 years, and where salt has been observed on pads. This could be crucial for assessing potential environmental impacts, such as soil salinization, or for planning remediation actions.\n\n### User description:\nA conservation officer or an environmental engineer might need this information to:\n- Evaluate the long-term effects of salt storage practices on local",
  "natural_language_query": "As an environmental professional looking into the management and protection of wetlands, I'm interested in conducting an audit regarding the storage of salt materials within certain districts. Specifically, I'm concerned with districts where the storage duration surpasses ten years and there is evidence of salt being placed on pads. \n\nTo achieve this, I would like to run a SQL query that targets records from two databases: `salt_storage_record_table` and `wetland_ecologist_districts`. My goal is to identify districts that meet the following criteria:\n\n1. The material type must be 'Salt'.\n2. The storage period should exceed 10 years.\n3. For each unique district, there should be at least one record in the `salt_storage_record_table` where it's explicitly mentioned that salt is present on a pad.\n\nThe query should provide me with the following details for each qualifying district:\n\n- **Unique Identifier**: The specific code or label that uniquely identifies each district.\n- **Agency Name**: The organization responsible for ecological work in that district.\n- **Abbreviated Name**: A concise representation of the agency's name or its official abbreviation.\n\nI'm also interested in understanding the relationship between these two databases through an INNER JOIN operation, ensuring that only records where the `FULCRUM_ID` matches between `salt_storage_record_table` and `wetland_ecologist_districts` are included in the results. This alignment will help validate that the storage activities align with the geographical districts under scrutiny.",
