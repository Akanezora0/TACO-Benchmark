  "problem_description": "### Query intent:\nThe SQL statement is designed to retrieve specific attributes from two tables (`outdoor_recreation_sites_inventory` and `lakepond_wbids_and_wbid_segments`) based on certain conditions, aiming to find details related to outdoor recreation sites that meet specific criteria.\n\n### Detailed description:\n\n#### Tables Involved:\n1. **`outdoor_recreation_sites_inventory`**:\n   - This table likely contains detailed records about outdoor recreational sites such as coordinates (`X`, `Y`), an object identifier (`OBJECTID`), map information (`MAP`, `MAP_NUMBER`), site name (`SITE_NAME`), public priority (`PUBLIC_PRI`), and possibly other attributes related to boating (`BOATING_MA`).\n\n2. **`lakepond_wbids_and_wbid_segments`**:\n   - This table might include information about geographic features like lakes or ponds (`Event_Type`), their associated identifiers (`OBJECTID`), and possibly acreage (`GIS_Acres`).\n\n#### Columns Selected:\n- The query selects several key columns from `outdoor_recreation_sites_inventory`:\n  - `X`, `Y`: Coordinates of the outdoor recreational site.\n  - `OBJECTID`, `MAP`, `MAP_NUMBER`: Identifier and mapping details for the site.\n  - `SITE_NAME`: Name of the site.\n  - `PUBLIC_PRI`: Public priority level of the site.\n  - `BOATING_MA`: Information potentially related to boating activities at the site.\n\n#### Join Condition:\n- The query uses an INNER JOIN clause to match records from both tables where the `OBJECTID` column values are equal. This ensures that only records with matching identifiers across both tables are included in the result set.\n\n#### Where Conditions:\n- **`lakepond_wbids_and_wbid_segments.Event_Type = 'Boating'`**: Filters to only include records where the event type is specifically 'Boating'. This narrows down the results to sites that are relevant for boating activities.\n- **`outdoor_recreation_sites_inventory.COUNTYCODE = '065'`**: Further filters the results to only include sites located within a specific county code (065).\n- **`lakepond_wbids_and_wbid_segments.GIS_Acres > 100`**: Ensures that only sites associated with geographic areas larger than 100 acres are considered.\n\n### Business Scenario:\nThis query is typically used in a scenario where an organization needs to identify and analyze outdoor recreational sites that are suitable for bo",
  "natural_language_query": "User: Hi there, I'm trying to pull some data on outdoor recreational sites that are particularly suited for boating activities. These sites should be located within a specific county, let's say it's County Code 065, and they need to be sizable enough, say more than 100 acres in area. Could you help me write a SQL query to fetch this information? Also, I'd like to see details like the coordinates, mapping information, site names, public priority levels, and any specific boating-related details for these sites.\n\nAssistant: Assistant: Sure, I can help with that! You're looking to gather information on outdoor recreational sites that are ideal for boating, located in a particular county with a specific code, and have a certain size. Hereâ€™s how you might structure your SQL query:\n\n```sql\nSELECT \n    os.X, os.Y, os.OBJECTID, os.MAP, os.MAP_NUMBER, os.SITE_NAME, os.PUBLIC_PRI, os.BOATING_MA\nFROM \n    outdoor_recreation_sites_inventory os\nINNER JOIN \n    lakepond_wbids_and_wbid_segments lws ON os.OBJECTID = lws.OBJECTID\nWHERE \n    lws.Event_Type = 'Boating'\nAND \n    os.COUNTYCODE = '065'\nAND \n    lws.GIS_Acres > 100;\n```\n\nThis query will select the coordinates (`X`, `Y`), an object identifier (`OBJECTID`), mapping details (`MAP`, `MAP_NUMBER`), site name (`SITE_NAME`), public priority (`PUBLIC_PRI`), and any boating-related details (`BOATING_MA`) from the `outdoor_recreation_sites_inventory` table, along with the associated geographic information from the `lakepond_wbids_and_wbid_segments` table. It ensures that only sites meeting your criteria are included in the results.",
