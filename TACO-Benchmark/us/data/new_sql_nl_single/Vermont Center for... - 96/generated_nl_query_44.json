  "problem_description": "### Query intent:\nThe SQL statement aims to retrieve specific data from two related tables: `outdoor_recreation_sites_inventory` and `salt_storage_record_table`. The goal is to find matching records where the `OBJECTID` from the `outdoor_recreation_sites_inventory` table corresponds to the `fulcrum_parent_id` in the `salt_storage_record_table`.\n\n### Detailed description:\n1. **Table `outdoor_recreation_sites_inventory`**:\n   - **Columns**:\n     - `X`: likely represents some geographical coordinate or identifier for outdoor recreation sites.\n     - `Y`: another geographical coordinate or identifier.\n     - `OBJECTID`: a unique identifier for each record in this table.\n\n2. **Table `salt_storage_record_table`**:\n   - **Columns**:\n     - `OBJECTID`: a unique identifier for records in this table.\n     - `fulcrum_parent_id`: a foreign key referencing the `OBJECTID` in the `outdoor_recreation_sites_inventory` table, indicating a parent-child relationship between the two tables.\n\n3. **Condition**:\n   - `outdoor_recreation_sites_inventory.OBJECTID = salt_storage_record_table.fulcrum_parent_id`: This condition ensures that only records from `outdoor_recreation_sites_inventory` are selected where their `OBJECTID` matches the `fulcrum_parent_id` in `salt_storage_record_table`. It implies that the system is looking for specific outdoor recreation sites that have associated salt storage records.\n\n### Business scenario:\nThis query could be used in a scenario where an organization manages both outdoor recreational areas and the storage facilities of salts (or other materials) used for winter road maintenance or other purposes. By linking these two datasets through a common identifier (`OBJECTID`), the system can efficiently retrieve information about which specific recreation sites have associated salt storage locations, possibly for auditing, planning, or maintenance purposes.\n\n### User description:\nA park manager or facility planner might need this information to ensure that all recreational areas within their jurisdiction have appropriate salt storage facilities nearby, for timely winter road salting operations. The query helps in identifying any gaps or redundancies in the current setup of salt storage and recreational areas, guiding future planning and resource allocation.",
  "natural_language_query": "A park administrator is tasked with ensuring efficient winter road maintenance operations across various recreational areas within their jurisdiction. To achieve this, they require a list of outdoor recreation sites that have associated salt storage facilities nearby. For this purpose, they aim to run a SQL query on the organization's database to identify matching records between two related tables: `outdoor_recreation_sites_inventory` and `salt_storage_record_table`.\n\nSpecifically, they are interested in finding instances where the `OBJECTID` field from the `outdoor_recreation_sites_inventory` table corresponds to the `fulcrum_parent_id` in the `salt_storage_record_table`. This will help them understand if each recreational site has a designated salt storage location, which is crucial for timely and effective road salting during winter months.\n\nUpon executing the query, the park administrator expects to receive a dataset that includes details from both tables, focusing on pairs where there is a direct link between a specific outdoor recreation site and its associated salt storage record. This information will assist in planning and optimizing the distribution of salt storage facilities to ensure they are conveniently located near all necessary recreational areas, thereby enhancing the overall efficiency and safety of winter road maintenance operations.",
